<h2>General Information</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p>The <acronym title="Icewind Dale II">IWD2</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> mod
    is a fan-made modification put together for fun, and not for profit. So,
    don't try to sell it. Two games in particular provided the major source of
    inspiration for this mod: Baldur's Gate II and Knights of the Old Republic.
    BioWare developed both of those excellent games. </p> 
  <p>The main goal of <acronym title="Icewind Dale II">IWD2</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> is
    to give an <acronym title="Icewind Dale II">IWD2</acronym> player the opportunity
    to play with joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> that
    are not silent. </p> 
  <p>The mod is rated <strong>M</strong>, for coarse language and adult situations.
    You can go to <strong>T</strong> rating if you exclude Salomeya and Sir Wind
    Nord from the party and tell the eligible characters that you are not interested
    in their romantic advances. </p> 
  <p>Mods which extend material presented here (new <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> for <acronym title="Icewind Dale II">IWD2</acronym> who
    banter with <acronym title="Icewind Dale II">IWD2</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>s,
    or romance for one of the <acronym title="Icewind Dale II">IWD2</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>s)
    are welcome as separate modifications, with the appropriate credit given
    to the authors. If you want something to become a direct part of this mod,
    you will need to contact <acronym title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</acronym>. </p> 
</div> 
<h2>The Quirks</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p>There are a few things you need to know before plunging into your Northern
    adventure, new companions by your side. </p> 
  <p>Please, don't forget to patch your game with the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/files/file/952-official-patches-icewind-dale-ii/">official Patch 2.01</a>. </p> 
  <p>If you want the party members to recognize a character as the main character,
    like Charname in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>, and banter
    with him/her, you will need to: </p> 
  <ul> 
    <li> Create him or her first. </li> 
    <li> Keep him or her in the first, leader's slot. </li> 
    <li> Have him or her as the only custom-created (ie not supplied by the mod)
      character. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>These three limitations are the direct effect of the difference between <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> and <acronym title="Icewind Dale II">IWD2</acronym> engine.
    If you don't do this, the <acronym title="Icewind Dale II">IWD2</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> will
    banter between one another and comment on the events in the game, but will
    not talk to the leader. </p> 
  <p>Other things to keep in mind are: </p> 
  <ul> 
    <li> The game displays only one portrait during each dialogue in the dialogue
      window: the portrait of the character talked to. </li> 
    <li> So far, the mod is not able to fix the quiet murmur of the characters
      that fight unarmed. </li> 
    <li> The <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>'s biography cannot
      be put into the designated spot, so the generic <acronym title="Icewind Dale II">IWD2</acronym> biography
      will still show there. Your <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>'s
      background introduced by the mod, and to which the <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> will
      refer to, will be written in your journal early in the game . </li> 
    <li> Until Weimer's Ease of Use is not updated to be compatible with the
      most recent version of <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>,
      this mod should be installed prior to <acronym title="Icewind Dale II">IWD2</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Project. </li> 
    <li> If any <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> was petrified,
      and then restored to life via Stone to Flesh, it will interfere with the
      character's file, and will eventually cause the game to crash when the
      character is called upon to say anything. So, you will need to either re-load
      and avoid the petrification, or import a new copy of the character via
      the Character Arbitration screen. </li> 
  </ul> 
</div> 
<h2>The <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym></h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p>The detailed description of the <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> is
    appended to this guide as <a href="readme-iwd2npc_appendixa.html">Appendix
    A</a>. </p> 
  <p>At the start of the game, you will have two options – either importing the
    full pre-created party of 6 <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> which
    will appear in your party selection menu as “Nord's Company” or you can select “New
    Party”, create your Protagonist and add 5 <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>.
    You will handle <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> join
    in and drop out via Import/Export. </p> 
  <p>Each <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> can be imported
    at different levels. Sir Nord, Salomeya, Jaemal, Diriel, Valeero and Rizdaer
    lend themselves more easily to having higher levels at party creation than <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>,
    Hildury, Peony, Prachi and Nikosh. Suggested levels are: </p> 
  <p>Level 6: Sir Nord and Valeero </p> 
  <p>Level 3: Diriel, Jaemal, Salomeya and Rizdaer </p> 
  <p>Level 1: Hildury, Nikosh, Peony and Prachi </p> 
  <p>When you are creating the character it is up to you if you want to use the
    portraits, colors and soundsets that are provided by the mod. Keeping each <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>'s
    name as it was given by the mod will save you a bit of confusion when you
    start seeing the banter. </p> 
  <p><acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> will also have some
    low-power items equipped on them. Your <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> will
    get a small gift as well in the very beginning of the game. </p> 
  <p>The Dialogues. </p> 
  <p>There are five basic types of banter in the mod. </p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Scenery Banter: Scenery banter includes interjections into the game texts
      and short commentary on what's going on. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Player-initiated dialogues. Player-initiated dialogues can be accessed
      via “P” button at any time, but its use is mostly utilitarian, allowing
      you to see a dialogue with an <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> earlier.
      The option to 'push' the next available banter will only help for those
      scripted to happen in that particular chapter. In two special cases <acronym title="Player-Initiated Dialogue">PID</acronym> is
      used to unlock some extra content. It will show an additional option for
      Diriel in Fell Forest , and one more for Sir Nord in Chapter 4 if you don't
      have Salomeya in the party. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
    <li><acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>-<acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Banter: <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> will
      talk to one another. These banters are distributed throughout the game
      and cannot be advanced using Ctrl+I cheat. You can however press “P” and
      select one of the options to see if you can ‘push' the next available banter.
      It will only help for banter that is scripted to happen in that particular
      chapter. The banter scripted to come later will come later. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Friendship sequences: All <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> will
      have 2 types of banter with your main character (providing you followed
      the guidelines for main character creation in the “Quirks” section): sequential
      and event-related. Expect to see roughly 1-2 sequential dialogues per chapter,
      and 1 “long” event related dialogue per chapter. You can press “P” and
      select one of the options to see if you can ‘push' the next available banter
      with the <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>. It will only
      help for banter that is scripted to happen in that particular chapter.
      The banter scripted to come later will come later. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Romantic Banter: Five <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> have
      additional romantic love-talks with the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>.
      Expect roughly 2 love-talks per chapter. You can press “P” and select one
      of the options to see if you can ‘push' the next available banter with
      the <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>. It will only help
      for banter that is scripted to happen in that particular chapter. The love-talks
      scripted to come later will come later. Flirts are a special type of the
      romantic banter. The <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>-initiated
      flirts will occur independently, increasing in frequency as your romance
      progresses. <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> initiated flirts
      can be accessed at any time when you are far enough in the romance via
      hitting the “P” button and selecting the appropriate option. </li> 
  </ul> 
</div> 
<h2>The Romances</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p>There are five <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> that
    you can romance. A male <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> can
    romance  Jaemal, Salomeya and Peony, while a female one– Diriel (elf
    only), Rizdaer and Jaemal. You can stop each <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> from
    romancing you at any time via <acronym title="Player-Initiated Dialogue">PID</acronym> menu.
    Additionally, most of the other characters have options in their friendship
    paths to flirt with them a little. Sometimes they are limited to the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>'s
    race (ie you can flirt with Hildury if you are a half-orc). That flirting
    does not result in the ‘full' romance, but will be reflected in the epilogues,
    if you didn't pursue one of the main romances. </p> 
  <p>The mod determines whether or not the <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> will
    romance you based on your character's build and what you say. None of the
    build parameters is prohibitive (except in Salomeya's case; she will not
    romance bards), but instead they decrease or increase your chances to romance
    the character. For example, if your <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> sports
    an exotic race (a Drow, Tiefling or Aasimar), it will increase his chances
    to romance Peony. The match will be determined after your character has the
    three first talks with the <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> (unless
    she or he indicates earlier that the romance is undesirable.). </p> 
  <p>While each character will take some abuse and insults, especially if s/he
    can't resist the character you've built, they might eventually lose interest
    in your <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> if what you say is
    not to their taste. </p> 
  <p>Other <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> can have romantic
    designs of their own on either your <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> or
    on the romanced <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>, or a
    romanced <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> might just have
    troubles choosing between the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> and
    an <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>. They will express
    their feelings via romantic conflicts. There are two types of romantic conflicts – the
    interjections into the early romantic dialogues, and the separate banters.
    The ‘main' conflicts (shown in bold for each romance below) will have additional
    banter and interjections; the ‘secondary' conflicts will have interjections
    only. </p> 
  <p>The Conflicts: </p> 
  <p> Diriel: <strong>Jaemal </strong>, <strong>Rizdaer </strong>, Salomeya,
    Nord, Valeero, Prachi </p> 
  <p>Jaemal: <strong>Rizdaer </strong>, <strong>Salomeya, </strong>Diriel (EL),
    Nikosh (HA or GN) </p> 
  <p>Rizdaer: <strong>Jaemal </strong>, <strong>Peony, </strong>Diriel (EL),
    Nikosh (HA or GN) </p> 
  <p>Peony: <strong>Rizdaer </strong>, <strong>Salomeya </strong>, Hildury (HO),
    Prachi </p> 
  <p>Salomeya: <strong>Jaemal </strong>, <strong>Peony </strong>, Hildury (HO),
    Prachi </p> 
  <p>Jaemal: <strong>Peony </strong>, <strong>Salomeya, </strong>Hildury (HO),
    Prachi </p> 
</div> 
<h2>The Portraits</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p>When you download the mod, the <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> will
    have the <acronym title="Icewind Dale II">IWD2</acronym> style portraits
    by Dani. A collection of <acronym title="Neverwinter Nights">NWN</acronym> style
    portraits suitable for the <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> is
    also downloaded in your portraits folder (they will start with “O”, for example
    old nord portraits will be ONORDL and ONORDS). You can customize the portrait
    for each <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> any time you
    wish during the game via Customize Appearance option. The <acronym title="Neverwinter Nights">NWN</acronym> style
    portraits will also appear in your custom portrait selection when you create
    your characters. </p> 
</div> 
<h2>The Cheese</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p>A couple of powerful +5 weapons (a bastard sword and a war hammer) can be
    summoned via CLUAConsole using the codes P#RIZBAS and P#RIZHAM. Originally
    they were intended as a gift from Sneaky Riki in the Severed Hand to Rizdaer,
    to help you defeat the avatar of Xvym, but as the title implies – they are
    cheesy overpowered pieces of work. </p> 
</div>
