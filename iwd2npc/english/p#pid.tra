@309  = ~Gotcha!~
@310  = ~(He seizes you by the waist, and kisses your hair.)~
@311  = ~(Sigh.) Between the wind and you, I think I should shave my head.~
@312  = ~(With mock seriousness.) My dear, I assure you that I have no fleas.~
@313  = ~(The dark, heavy strands slide between your fingers, refusing to look any messier than they were.)~
@314  = ~Hmm... I think you like my hair-do ala ice wind.~
@315  = ~Hmm, if you keep doing this, I'll have to take studying dragon lore under consideration.~
@316  = ~I've heard that some sorcerers can harden their hide that way.~
@317  = ~(He pokes you back softly.)~
@318  = ~Still only flesh and blood, both of us.~
@319  = ~I think I was just pierced by a broad head arrow. Good bye, my love. (With exaggerated seriousness he presses his palms to his chest, sends you his last kiss and tumbles to the ground. There he lays still.)~
@320  = ~(Leave him there.)~
@321  = ~(Investigate.)~
@322  = ~(He lifts his arm and gently strokes your cheek before getting back to his feet.)~
@323  = ~Let us go, my love.~
@324  = ~(Jaemal suddenly sits up, pale in the face.) I'm sorry... I don't like this game.~
@325  = ~(He lays very still, holding his breath, then, when you lean over him grabs you into his arms, laughing and kissing you incessantly.)~
@326  = ~Not even a tear for your poor lover?~
@327  = ~Oh, miracle, I'm hale again! (He jumps up to his feet and catches up with you.)~
@328  = ~Ouch! One word: Stoneskin!~
@329  = ~Those mischievous little hands.... (Tenderly, yet firmly, he takes your hands in his and give each a small kiss in turn.)~
@330  = ~(For a moment, he tries to pretend to ignore the tickles, but the breaks into helpless laughter, cavorting as you're wiggling your fingers.)~
@331  = ~I give! Mercy, kind lady, mercy! (He throws his arms up in mock surrender. The folds of his cloak fly wide providing an opportunity to slide your hand inside his robes.)~
@332  = ~You're spared... for now.~
@333  = ~Northern Light.... (He seems at a loss of what to say.)~
@334  = ~(You'd think Jaemal turned into a statue as your fingers touch the soft curls on his chest, while the back of your palm slides against the heavy brocaded silk.)~
@335  = ~(Jaemal trembles.) Hands... you have such cold hands.~
@336  = ~Thank you. (A small smile plays on his lips for a while yet.)~
@337  = ~(Laughing, Jaemal tries to defend himself, even press his own attack. He's more than a match to you, so in the end you go down in a heap, still struggling to out-tickle one another.)~
@338  = ~Northern Light?~
@339  = ~(Kiss Jaemal's cheek.)~
@340  = ~(Kiss Jaemal on the lips.)~
@341  = ~(Kiss Jaemal's ear.)~
@342  = ~(Kiss Jaemal's forhead.)~
@343  = ~(Kiss Jaemal's nose.)~
@344  = ~(Kiss Jaemal's eyelids.)~
@345  = ~(His eyelids tremble, his lips smile.) It's like gentle ray of a northern sun. I can almost see the golden glow around you.~
@346  = ~(His dark eyelashes tickle your lips. Not surprisingly, it's his eyes that arrest people's glances, but truly, he has beautiful long eyelashes, when you have a chance to see them.)~
@347  = ~Are you tired of looking into this sorcerer's eyes? A kiss, I dare say, is more pleasant than- ~
@348  = ~Never mind. I'm sorry for being so morbid, my love.~
@349  = ~Do tell, please.~
@350  = ~You have no reason to be morbid.~
@351  = ~Think about our love, and the dark thoughts will evaporate.~
@352  = ~I know what you're thinking of. Don't.~
@353  = ~I won't. Besides, you won't let them do anything like that to me, I know.~
@354  = ~And so they will. Sweet one, I don't know how anything dark doesn't shrivel and fall into dust in your presence.~
@355  = ~You're right and so I won't. (Jaemal kisses your temple.) Let's go, Northern Light.~
@356  = ~That it's more pleasant than the lead pallets some urge to weigh my kind's eyes with after death.~
@357  = ~(Even with his eyes closed, you can feel the raw energy of his gaze under those eyelids.)~
@358  = ~Your lips smell like honeyed wine, Northern Light.~
@359  = ~(He wrinkles his nose funnily.) And what do I do now...~
@360  = ~...but this? (Jaemal gently touches the very tip of your nose with his lips.) Hmm, this is not the most passionate of kisses, yet there's something wonderfully warm and intimate about it.~
@361  = ~(The tip of Jaemal's nose is probably the only part of his body that feels cool to the touch.)~
@362  = ~(He rubs his nose against yours, laughing softly.)~
@363  = ~(Jaemal runs his fingers down the length of your neck.)~
@364  = ~(A simple gesture, yes, but he does it with a quiet tenderness that can be nothing but a fond thank you for the kiss.)~
@365  = ~I'm not your brother, Northern Light. Lovers kiss on the lips.~
@366  = ~You are going to erase the creases left to me by fatigue and former misfortunes, my love.~
@367  = ~(Jaemal stands very still while your lips brush his forehead. He even holds his breath, it seems.) I'm afraid to scare the kiss away.~
@368  = ~(As you explore the perimeter of the man's ear with your lips and tongue, Jaemal suddenly giggles.) What you're doing, Northern Light... it tickles!~
@369  = ~I love the sound of that. (He leans his head toward you, rubbing his temple against your forehead.)~
@370  = ~(Jaemal hugs your waist, and whispers in your ear.) You might as well whisper something sweet to me while you are at it. Like this.~
@371  = ~I love you. (He gently nibbles your earlobe.)~
@372  = ~(Soft, raven-black ringlets tickle your nose as you kiss Jaemal's ear.)~
@373  = ~(He touches your lips with his finger, and smiles.) So much temptation in every minute thing about you.~
@374  = ~And I'm too weak to resist. (He takes your chin between his fingers and holds it lightly while passionately returning your kiss.)~
@375  = ~I treasure every kiss you give me, Northern Light.~
@376  = ~(Jaemal catches you by your arm.) Wait, wait... please.~
@377  = ~(Still holding you, he takes a long, longing look at you.)  I'd give anything for a chance to be alone with you, far away from grief, blood and war.~
@378  = ~(He closes his eyes.) I must remember every little detail of it. You face getting closer, the glitter of a smile in your eyes, the first softness of you lips.~
@379  = ~(He opens his eyes and shakes his head ruefully.) No, I can't. You will need to give me another taste.~
@380  = ~(Aasimar's skin, always warm to the touch, is especially soothing in the chilly North. And it seems to grow hotter under your lips. As you pull back, you see Jaemal blush.)~
@381  = ~I think about you kissing me every time I shave. That's the only thing that keeps me from cursing every time I nearly cut an ear off. Oh, well.  I suppose I'll get better in time. ~
@382  = ~(His skin has a faint spicy smell to it, a reminder of the exotic lands far away, lands of the scorching sun, blowing sands, and ruthless gods.)~
@383  = ~Mmgh... You're spoiling me. I could get used to beautiful women appearing from nowhere to kiss me. Of course I'd have to send them away. All save you.~
@384  = ~(Jaemal says nothing, but his kiss conveys 'I love you', 'I treasure you' and 'I want you' better than any words.)~
@385  = ~If I had a choice, Northern Light, I'd spend every morning lazing around and browsing your body with my lips.~
@386  = ~We're short of time for pleasure and idling of this sort, but... (His kiss feels as if it was steeped in longing for those leisurely delights.)~
@387  = ~A kiss for your lips, a kiss for your brow, two kisses for your cheeks....~
@388  = ~Will the sun rise in the east come the dawn?~
@389  = ~(And if the sun was as enthusiastic as Jaemal, you'd be watching a dozen of sunrises every morn.)~
@390  = ~Here's in the face of all those who say that mercenaries only dance with death and wed their swords!~
@391  = ~(Smiling, widely Jaemal takes your hands in his, and you do a few short steps before running out of room.)~
@392  = ~Ah, those damnable close quarters! (He pulls you closer, a happy chuckle belying his words.)~
@393  = ~Are you sure? I imagine that you have danced in the high halls, lit with thousands of candles. And with men who didn't learn their steps on a country faire, after they had too much wine.~
@394  = ~Which faire, Jaemal?~
@395  = ~I did. But right now I really want to see just how well they taught you at that faire.~
@396  = ~There's a certain charm in dancing minuet while barefoot, my love.~
@397  = ~Call me strange, but I prefer a certain vagabond to all the elegant men as my dancing partner.~
@398  = ~You're right. What was I thinking?~
@399  = ~Do you still remember how we danced minuet?~
@400  = ~Didn't you learn anything in Fema under the Sands?~
@401  = ~Those were their sacred rituals, my love, not lovers' delights.~
@402  = ~I'm sorry. The memory is overwhelming. We'll dance another time.~
@403  = ~I don't forget anything you teach me, Northern Light.~
@404  = ~(And yet again, you pace elegantly in the imaginary palace.)~
@405  = ~I wouldn't know. (Jaemal turns away, stiff-backed.)~
@406  = ~I'm happy that you do. (He takes your hand and leads you through rambunctious steps of the dance that the simple folk dance, come the spring.)~
@407  = ~A point well made and well taken. But you will have to teach me minuet.~
@408  = ~It was just a figure of speech. We'll dance whatever you know.~
@409  = ~I'll be delighted!~
@410  = ~To be honest I don't like it. I'd rather we dance something that doesn't keep us at a formal distance from each other.~
@411  = ~(Jaemal embraces you by your shoulders, and you sway together to a sad tune he's whistling.)~
@412  = ~(Step by measured step, you dance this ultimate expression of courtly love and refined tastes on the edge of the world in travel-stained clothes with a former slave.)~
@413  = ~There's something both very right and very wrong about it.~
@414  = ~(Jaemal dances gracefully, if artlessly.)~
@415  = ~(Then for a short moment, light is everywhere, reflected in a myriads of crystal facets, there are festive smells, rustle of heavy silks and gentle music...)~
@416  = ~(Just like that it's gone, and you can't tell from Jaemal's smile if you shared the vision, or it was all yours.)~
@417  = ~(And so you swirl and bow and turn in the middle of nowhere and to the music that only two of you can hear.)~
@418  = ~(Jaemal does dance like a villager, but what he lacks in training is compensated by the luster in his eyes set squarely on you, and you alone.~
@419  = ~I honestly don't know. It was a dark year for me. I just remember that girl laughing, and laughing and laughing at my clumsiness.~
@420  = ~But I got better, and I don't think you should laugh at me.~
@421  = ~Do you care for a dance, Northern Light?~
@422  = ~(Jaemal hums a tune.) I think this will do nicely, Northern Light. Let's give it a try!~
@423  = ~Let me think... Hmm... (Drums his fingers against his cheek.)~
@424  = ~Yes.~
@425  = ~(Looking deep into your eyes, he speaks, emphasizing each word.) ~
@426  = ~The first moment I saw you, I loved you.~
@427  = ~(He throws his head back, and his arms wide to his sides, and bellows for the whole world to hear.)~
@428  = ~Love, worship, adore....~
@429  = ~I love you, too.~
@430  = ~Sometimes it almost scares me, for how many times can one man defeat the odds stacked against him. There will be a price to pay, I tell myself, there must be a price...~
@431  = ~It almost scares me. Almost. But there is nothing I won't give to have had your love.~
@432  = ~That's good, because I don't care much for the plane of existence where you're not in love with me, and where I don't love you.~
@433  = ~You make me glad beyond all reason when you say this.~
@434  = ~(Your relationship with Jaemal is a balancing act right now. Perhaps a little show of affection can make him more sure of himself.)~
@435  = ~(Put your arm through his.)~
@436  = ~Your hands are so soft....~
@437  = ~(Jaemal is startled, and your touch sends a small shiver through him.)~
@438  = ~(He weaves his fingers through yours with care.)~
@439  = ~(Jaemal responds with a gentle squeeze of his own, and doesn't let go of your hand.)~
@440  = ~(For a time you walk together, hand in hand.)~
@441  = ~I love it when you look at me like this. It makes me think that you know what's on my mind and understand me better than I do myself.~
@442  = ~That's how the well-water must feel when it reflects the stars.~
@443  = ~(There is something bare, and something raw in the way Jaemal looks at you.)~
@444  = ~(His eyes are... his eyes are of the sort that a cautious woman wouldn't look into.)~
@445  = ~Your smile is something very special, very good... in every sense of this word.~
@446  = ~(The look on his face becomes both boyish and happy. Though it's doubtful that Jaemal felt happy often, if ever, during his boyhood.) ~
@447  = ~(Jaemal crosses what distance separated you in two hurried steps.) What else could iron shavings do in a presence of a magnet?~
@448  = ~(He notices your smile and immediately, almost instinctively his lips curve in return.)~
@449  = ~You know, sometimes I feel that you are a dream. I pinch myself then, and see that you are real, and marvel in wonder.~
@450  = ~Of course. Those are the best and the worst dreams I have. The best, because they are about you, the worst, because too often I must save you from a horrid danger, and I am scared, so scared for you.~
@451  = ~Yes. Do you?~
@452  = ~Yes. Isn't that fascinating?~
@453  = ~No, though I wish I did.~
@454  = ~I do, but they are scary, those dreams. Torture, death, chases...~
@455  = ~I don't.~
@456  = ~You're a sound sleeper. I can testify to that.~
@457  = ~Don't worry, this but a reflection of our reality. (But he looks troubled nonetheless.)~
@458  = ~When you're awake, I'm never far.~
@459  = ~Everything about you is fascinating.~
@460  = ~Every night.~
@461  = ~You know when they say the sun and the moon are courting each other, but they can never quite touch? Sometimes... sometimes I wonder the same about you and I. And then I weep at my own folly.~
@462  = ~Yes, that's what it is. Merriment. Of course.~
@463  = ~(Gods, the man is a fool and the girl is even stupider. If we ever run across a dictionary someone better find the word "eunuch" for her. Or she's bound for a surprise or two on her wedding night)~
@464  = ~Are you giggling now too, Salomeya?~
@465  = ~How can I resist? She has such a *virulent* laughter!~
@466  = ~(Yes, a two-way man... at least.)~
@467  = ~Ah, poor toe! Well, at least you don't have to worry about other parts like the whole men.~
@468  = ~(sigh)~
@469  = ~Of course.~
@470  = ~Feelings. So you still want to play this strange game.~
@471  = ~I cannot claim to understand your attraction for a man who is not even a man, but you're a woman, so the descision is yours.~
@472  = ~Friends? Mistress, I don't believe in friendship. But I take it as you don't want me for your consort. The descision is yours.~
@473  = ~Mistress, you don't want me for your consort, I understand.~
@474  = ~(Your lover is never too far away from you.)~
@475  = ~Rizdaer, I think we gave up on our dancing lesson way too early.~
@476  = ~(Kiss Rizdaer.)~
@477  = ~(Stroke Rizdaer's back.)~
@478  = ~(Give his rear end a good slap.)~
@479  = ~(Catch up with Rizdaer, and put your arm through his elbow.)~
@480  = ~(Take his hands in yours.)~
@481  = ~(Wrap your arm around his waist.)~
@482  = ~(Psst, Rizdaer, I think we can have a quick sojourn away from others.)~
@483  = ~I want something from your drow repertoire of caresses.~
@484  = ~(Straighten up Rizdaer's cloak for him.)~
@485  = ~(Take Rizdaer's helmet off, and ruffle his hair.)~
@486  = ~(Trace the outline of Rizdaer's lips with your fingertip.)~
@487  = ~(Pinch Rizdaer's ear.)~
@488  = ~(Exhale some air into Rizdaer's mouth.)~
@489  = ~I heard that drow males were either fighters or wizards. Well, I wish you were the latter. All this metal! How am I suppose to give you a quick caress when nobody's looking?~
@490  = ~(Bite Rizdaer's neck lightly.)~
@491  = ~(Give an icicle a long, sensual lick.)~
@492  = ~(In a smoky tone) Rrrizdaaaer....~
@493  = ~(Lean into him, arching your back against Rizdaer's chest with a little moan.)~
@494  = ~(Lean into him, arching your back against Rizdaer's  chest with a little moan.)~
@495  = ~(Sway your hips and wink at him.)~
@496  = ~Do you have any... wishes or desires of your own, Rizdaer?~
@497  = ~Rizdaer, I love another. I love Jaemal.~
@498  = ~Our relationship... Rizdaer, I don't want to hurt you, but I'd like us to remain friends, and nothing more.~
@499  = ~You're a slug, and I hate your guts. Don't you ever dare to presume I like you.~
@500  = ~Rizdaer, I'm not trying to push you away, but I'd like a bit less attention. Perhaps, if we stop flirting, it would be better.~
@501  = ~Do you mean, in bed?~
@502  = ~Yes, in bed. You... you've never asked me to do anything special for you.~
@503  = ~Yes, in bed, my love.~
@504  = ~Where else, sweetling?~
@505  = ~(Blush.) N-n-no. Just... just in general.~
@506  = ~Well, that's a whole different issue all together. But let's start with something more general. Is there anything you want at all?~
@507  = ~I see.~
@508  = ~The more often you ask me about it, the wilder my desires become.~
@509  = ~It proved to be a very pleasant thing to think of.~
@510  = ~I want to be warm again. ~
@511  = ~I want to understand and experience some things that brighten your eyes. Like the stench of flowers, or the sting of the noon sun. ~
@512  = ~I'd like to drop the disguise and walk around with my true coloring, unnoticed by anyone.~
@513  = ~I wish to find a castle, and a room in the castle. Then I'd lock a door, and sleep for a day or two without having to be on my guard.~
@514  = ~There is no castle like that though. Not for the likes of me.~
@515  = ~Nothing fancy today, lady. Just the deed, after we've ate something.~
@516  = ~I often want to thrust into you past the clothes, past the armor, past your surfacers' inhibitions, when our blood is high after a battle won.~
@517  = ~The drow priestesses, they always pull the strongest warrior into their midst after the victory was assured. It is the only times that they could ever forget who is a slave to whom.~
@518  = ~I hesitate to ask, but I wish that at least once, you'd undressed, and bathed, and loved me, with me being passive and unmoving save for what has to be erect.~
@519  = ~At times, I want to love you in the complete dark, sensing your form rather than seeing. At times, I want to risk it, and love you out in the open, oblivious of the dangers of your roofless world.~
@520  = ~I thought that satisfying a woman was a dangerous test of endurance to be avoided. I came to want to sheath into you so often that sometimes I want to be brief. ~
@521  = ~The swell of your breasts fascinates me. The women of the Underdark, they are hard, compared to you, as if their chests are mailed to protect them from a treacherous dagger.~
@522  = ~Yours are different. I like their touch on every part of my body.~
@523  = ~I want you in my bed, and only you, not another female, even if she is more powerful and influential. Even Matron Baenre-~
@524  = ~(Coughs.) In fact, the thought of pleasuring the two thousand years old Matron Baenre of the First House, now makes me gag, when before I'd simply jump is she'd ordered me... without thinking of attraction.~
@525  = ~So, I thought long and hard, and I came to the conclusion that my sole desire is to serve you, Mistress, and fulfill you every whim.~
@526  = ~(The way he grins as he genuflects in the most humble way possible tells you that he has plenty of ideas, actually.)~
@527  = ~I've never been asked about that before, my Mystery. You took me by surprise. Let me think of it, and then I'll have an answer for you.~
@528  = ~(He strokes your hip lightly, and winks back at you.)~
@529  = ~(Rizdaer repeats the gesture.)~
@530  = ~What? This was funny?... I suppose it was.~
@531  = ~Your hips are made for childbirth, Matron. May you bear many strong females.~
@532  = ~(Grins.)~
@533  = ~Hmm, now that I think of it, one goes with the other nicely.~
@534  = ~(Rizdaer runs his palm along your spine, sending shivers shooting through your back.)~
@535  = ~My knees are buckling under me, lady, I want you so much.~
@536  = ~(If making love like that, under the cover of the cloak, wasn't what you had in mind exactly... well, Rizdaer certainly misunderstood your intentions.)~
@537  = ~(Rizdaer's hands slide from your waist down to your hips a few times.)~
@538  = ~Lady, I don't care that there are eyes on us, but you used to.~
@539  = ~(He buries his face in your hair, while his arms are encircling your waist.)~
@540  = ~Such a perfectly strange woman you are.~
@541  = ~(His smiles are rare. And grateful ones are even rarer.)~
@542  = ~(But it seems that the smile is not enough. He crosses the distance between you two and embraces you.)~
@543  = ~(He unlaces his cloak.) Is this place getting suddenly warmer?~
@544  = ~I heard a sirine once, and she sounded similar. I killed her, but I think I'll spare you.~
@545  = ~It takes more than that to make me lose my focus.~
@546  = ~Your voice is troubling and exciting whenever you get a chill, but I'd rather you were hale.~
@547  = ~(He takes the icicle from you, and it crunches between his strong teeth.)~
@548  = ~Cold.~
@549  = ~(He takes the icicle from your hands.)~
@550  = ~You've chilled your fingers, lady. And your mouth.~
@551  = ~(He endeavors to fix both alleged problems by rubbing your fingers between his palms, and kissing your mouth energetically.)~
@552  = ~(Rizdaer is watching you, absolutely mesmerized.)~
@553  = ~It's been a long day of sweat and blood. Wait till I wash at the camp, and then you can bite any place you wish.~
@554  = ~My little mouse. (Tickles your neck under your hair before you pull away.)~
@555  = ~(Rizdaer's glance slides casually across your chest.) Hmm, I wonder how my friend is doing....~
@556  = ~(You've renewed a 'bead' on a necklace made of the bite marks Rizdaer asked you to do for him last night.)~
@557  = ~I see your dilemma. I've had to deal with a fair share of chainmail and adamantine plating in my time. The priestesses are never patient.~
@558  = ~Insistently.~
@559  = ~After I've taken the plate off.~
@560  = ~Gently.~
@561  = ~I wish it did help my throat. It's raw as a boar's hide. But I appreciate the thought.~
@562  = ~(Rizdaer catches your head between his palms and turns it into a kiss.)~
@563  = ~Now, lady, if you want to take my last breath as a memory, it's done the other way around, and I have to be dying.~
@564  = ~Wild mint, wasn't it? I like the fragrance.~
@565  = ~Measuring it for a necklace, love?~
@566  = ~(He leans over and nibbles gently on your ear in response.)~
@567  = ~This helmet was obviously designed for dwarves, not elves. The proper work would protect me from ear-pinchers.~
@568  = ~Everyone wants a piece of me. Goblins, orcs, driders, my lover...~
@569  = ~(The smile forms as your finger make their way along the lip line. It makes the journey longer, but observing this change in the terrain keeps it interesting.)~
@570  = ~(Very white teeth flash between his dark lips.)~
@571  = ~Careful, Mistress, he bites.~
@572  = ~(His lips are carved, with well-defined sharp angles, so typical of the elves.)~
@573  = ~(Rizdaer softly catches the tips of your fingers between his lips, and sucks on them.)~
@574  = ~(Rizdaer rubs his temples tiredly under the fringe of tangled locks.)~
@575  = ~Shall we camp soon? It's been a long day. (The spark in his eyes belies the other reason for this suggestion.)~
@576  = ~There are strong winds here on the surface, and I think I've caught one.~
@577  = ~(He catches you in his arms, and gives you a hasty kiss.) Let's move on, lady, we have things to kill.~
@578  = ~(He pushes hair out of his eyes.)~
@579  = ~Sometimes I wonder why I bother putting steel over myself at all. The sword is all that a good fighter needs to defend himself.~
@580  = ~(Rizdaer rolls his head from one shoulder to another, massaging his neck. The mussed up strands of hair roll over his forehead and shoulders.)~
@581  = ~(His hands start with re-arranging your cloak, but quickly slip underneath.) This dreaded cold makes us wear all these furs, cloaks, leathers, woolens.... I hear there are warm places on the surface.~
@582  = ~We should go there. I want to behold you in wisps of silks.~
@583  = ~No, don't!~
@584  = ~It's too dirty to let it touch your hands.~
@585  = ~ Why... never mind.  (Rizdaer kneels and re-laces your boot.)~
@586  = ~I... Thank you. (Rizdaer is visibly astonished, and pleased by what you've done.~
@587  = ~Spider's silk, two sapphires and a vial of fragrant oil. I used to have a charm made of those. It ignited females. It was stolen, of course, with the rest of my things, but it's the last thing I'm missing.~
@588  = ~You don't need magic to find me attractive and desirable.~
@589  = ~(And then he busies his mouth with things other than words; things directly related to desire.)~
@590  = ~(Rizdaer kisses you on the lips, barely touching his mouth to yours. Gently, ever so gently.)~
@591  = ~This is not drow, lady, but that’s what I wanted to do to you.~
@592  = ~Send them on the wild goose chase then, so we have time to catch it.~
@593  = ~(Nods.) Understood.~
@594  = ~Of course, lady. But don't tell me that I didn't warn you. It's not going to be quick.~
@595  = ~(He hugs your waist in turn.) Now we look like brambles.~
@596  = ~I heard surface men in the taverns go on and on about lustful drow wenches, but in truth, you devote much more time to stirring desire.~
@597  = ~Your touch might not be intense, but it's doing the job.~
@598  = ~Lady, a chain would do better.~
@599  = ~(Grins up at you.) But that wasn't what you had in mind.~
@600  = ~That's nice, but dangerous.~
@601  = ~(He traps your hand in his.) Don't let go just yet.~
@602  = ~(He flexes his fingers.) It does not feel right to hold a woman's hand instead of a sword.~
@603  = ~I hear you surfacers, find many pleasures away from what's proper. Mayhap I'm starting to understand why.~
@604  = ~(Quietly) My sword hand is my most precious possession. And I'll cut it off myself, if needed for you.~
@605  = ~(You notice the semicircles of ebony skin around his fingernails.)~
@606  = ~(While shorter than the surface elves, Rizdaer has the kind of presence that would have made even the roughest and drunk-most sailors bite their tongues in the Luskan Docks, if you were walking there. Regrettably, the Legion's minions have much less common sense.)~
@607  = ~(Rizdaer visibly tries to relax, and act as if it's a natural thing for him to walk with a woman on his elbow, but every muscle in his body is tight. It seems you've just taught the old dog a new trick.)~
@608  = ~Hmm. Why not? The critters around here are pathetic enough to be beaten with one hand... well, not quite tied behind my back, but close enough. ~
@609  = ~(He grins crookedly.) Just hold on tight, lady.~
@610  = ~(He carefully untangles himself.) Not now, beautiful. I must be able to defend you.~
@611  = ~(Your hand follows the tight line of the man's spine to what is supposed to be among his softer assets. Well, perhaps Rizdaer's heart *is* the softest bit of him after all, at least since he met you)~
@612  = ~(The slap can easily turn into a mission of exploration.)~
@613  = ~(Explore.)~
@614  = ~(Slap was satisfactory enough.)~
@615  = ~Lady, you hurt your sweet fingers more than my rear end. Try this when we're undressed.~
@616  = ~No, once again, I will not reply in kind. There are some things a drow male just doesn't do.~
@617  = ~I take it that I misbehaved. I hope this will work towards earning your forgiveness.~
@618  = ~(Rizdaer kisses the palm that delivered the blow.)~
@619  = ~Guard my back, and I will guard yours.~
@620  = ~A female once released a giant pet spider to walk on my bare back. I guess I didn't please her enough. So, as I was lying there, With the poison dripping from the spider's mandibles and onto my neck, I asked her if it would please the mistress if I turned around to face it. She replied: 'It would be too much of an honor for you to look into its beautiful face.'~
@621  = ~Luckily, the spider was overfed, so it didn't bite me... much.~
@622  = ~(He turns his head to look at you with a strange smile.) It took plenty of beating.~
@623  = ~(Rizdaer arches his back under your palm like a huge cat.)~
@624  = ~(Oh, hells. Breathing is overrated and that was one dizzying kiss!)~
@625  = ~(That's when you start running out of air.)~
@626  = ~(Break off the kiss.)~
@627  = ~(Continue kissing Rizdaer.)~
@628  = ~(A disappointed sigh escapes everyone's lips as you pull your head back a little, but don't interrupt the kiss.)~
@629  = ~(Someone in your party is now tapping his or her foot impatiently.)~
@630  = ~(That's when your companions start giving you curious stares....)~
@631  = ~It was wonderful, but too short....~
@632  = ~(The rest of your companions politely look another way.)~
@633  = ~No wet lips whispering something inaudible into my ear? A pity, I was starting to get used to this surface custom.~
@634  = ~That's the best boon I can think of. Well, with you still dressed.~
@635  = ~(Rizdaer licks his lips, hunting for the fleeting taste of your kiss, and looking very much like a cat who got into cream.)~
@636  = ~(While you are humming a tune, Rizdaer quickly learns the steps from you. By the glint in his eyes, he still prefers that other kind of dancing.)~
@637  = ~(He properly takes your hand into his but gets distracted with kissing your fingers.)~
@638  = ~(He lifts you up in the air and gives you a good swirl around.) Now, this, this I like.~
@639  = ~Why you like this more than the blanket version, I can't comprehend. (Rizdaer's mind is definitely not on dancing, and his fingers are definitely not where they are supposed to be.) ~
@640  = ~(He steps back from you.) We will have to go with a dance where I don't have to touch you.~
@641  = ~(His arm does not seem to be able to stay around your waist. Instead it slides lower, a move that would not gain you approval in a noble house's ballroom.)~
@642  = ~(Instead of taking your hand into his, Rizdaer puts it around your waist as well, and sighs contentedly.)~
@643  = ~(Rizdaer pulls you closer and kisses you urgently.) Good dancing.~
@644  = ~Very well. I put one hand around your waist, like this-~
@645  = ~Don't we dance enough under the blankets?~
@646  = ~Yes, but I want to put your elven grace to a good use.~
@647  = ~(Blush) Rizdaer! ~
@648  = ~It's different. ~
@649  = ~Nope. ~
@650  = ~(Rizdaer looks thoughtful.)~
@651  = ~(Glance at Rizdaer.)~
@652  = ~(Stroke Rizdaer's cheek) ~
@653  = ~(Sigh.)~
@654  = ~(Smile at Rizdaer.)~
@655  = ~Rizdaer? (Touch him lightly on the arm.)~
@656  = ~Care for a drink of wine?~
@657  = ~I think you are very handsome, Rizdaer.~
@658  = ~How do you say 'I love you,' in drow?~
@659  = ~(Take Rizdaer's helmet off and ruffle his hair.)~
@660  = ~(Catch up with Rizdaer and put your arm through his elbow.)~
@661  = ~I want to be allowed to... to just be by the surfacers.~
@662  = ~Wishes, desires... (Shrugs.) I don't think so.~
@663  = ~I'm not used to talking or thinking about them, lady. They spring up, and I either act upon them or not.~
@664  = ~Sometimes... sometimes I just want to be left alone.~
@665  = ~I see. I'm sorry for having had intrud-~
@666  = ~Ha!~
@667  = ~And that's it?~
@668  = ~I think so, yes.~
@669  = ~Precisely.~
@670  = ~(Takes your hand and stops you from leaving.) But not now, and... and never by you.~
@671  = ~You look attractive when you do this thing with your eyes and your mouth.~
@672  = ~You, surfacers have certainly discovered many more nuances of a smile than the drow.~
@673  = ~I wish I knew what amuses you so about me.~
@674  = ~(He smiles back. His teeth are a flash of white between dark lips.)~
@675  = ~Regrets are useless. We must go on.~
@676  = ~It touches me. As if the air you exhaled touched my cheek. I can't explain it.~
@677  = ~(Sigh.) I... I felt like doing so as well.~
@678  = ~I don't like it when you sigh. It makes me wish to do... something. To fix things.~
@679  = ~You confuse, infuriate, and amuse me all at the same time.~
@680  = ~(His skin is smooth and cool under your fingers.)~
@681  = ~(Without the benefit of dark skin color, an almost rosy blush is evident on Rizdaer's cheek.)~
@682  = ~(Rizdaer catches your hand.)~
@683  = ~(For a moment he looks at his prize, as if not sure what to do with it, then gives your fingers an unsure squeeze.)~
@684  = ~(Rizdaer drops his eyes, but lifts them back on you immediately, a steely resolve in his gaze.)~
@685  = ~(He licks his lips nervously.)~
@686  = ~(Rizdaer nods assertively.)~
@687  = ~Yes, Mistress?~
@688  = ~How are you doing, Rizdaer?~
@689  = ~Kiss me.~
@690  = ~(Kiss Rizdaer)~
@691  = ~(Roll a strand of Rizdaer's hair around your finger.)~
@692  = ~I know that you despise the Sun, but what of the Moon?~
@693  = ~I would like to show you the beauty of my world.~
@694  = ~So, Rizdaer, if a drow male likes a drow female, what does he do?~
@695  = ~That would be a waste of time, Mistress.~
@696  = ~You mean, other than shielding you from death with my body at my dying moment? (He pretends to consider the question seriously.)~
@697  = ~Of course not.~
@698  = ~No.~
@699  = ~I can't afford such luxury.~
@700  = ~I'm still standing, yes?~
@701  = ~You don't need to check on me, Mistress. I will not betray you.~
@702  = ~I'm doing my duty.~
@703  = ~Freezing, Mistress, but ready to fight on your command.~
@704  = ~(He stares into your eyes, a strange, reckless expression on his face.)~
@705  = ~(For once, Rizdaer's sullen eyes are not transfixed on you. If you wish, you could take a good look at him.)~
@706  = ~(But you don't.)~
@707  = ~(Enjoy the opportunity.)~
@708  = ~(If one had to describe Rizdaer in one word, it would have been 'lithe'. Boiled leather, furs, and metal only seem to emphasize the drow's leanness. He's long-limbed, and is an epitome of the wiry strength that elves are famous for. Even his face is thin, though not to the point of hollow. The only thing that is not slick is his hair, carefully bound at the nape of his neck with a leather band.)~
@709  = ~(A bow.) At your service, Mistress.~
@710  = ~(You're surprised to see that he was watching you.)~
@711  = ~(Rizdaer stands patiently as you play with his hair.)~
@712  = ~If you like it, you should have it. (Before you can say anything, Rizdaer hacks a lock with a dagger, and hands it to you.)~
@713  = ~(A pale ring of silk glistens around your finger.)~
@714  = ~It was white, once. Now... (He waves his hand derisively.)~
@715  = ~Drow females sigh after taking their pleasure from a male. Surfacers seem to have other reasons.~
@716  = ~Worry not, Mistress. We're still winning.~
@717  = ~I, too, sometimes feel the need to expel that frozen air from my chest. It's cold, stiff and biting.~
@718  = ~(If Rizdaer understood that you sighed on his account, he didn't show it.)~
@719  = ~(Rizdaer smiles back. It looks more like a scowl, but he's trying, at least.)~
@720  = ~(He jerks away from you.)~
@721  = ~(Rizdaer bows, a perplexed expression on his face.)~
@722  = ~(Rizdaer frowns thoughtfully, as if trying to understand the motives behind you smiling at him.)~
@723  = ~It's an idol for the fools who worship Eilistraee. I'm not one of them.~
@724  = ~I don't know. In the South, the nights are good. But here, it's freezing cold when the sun goes down. Sun, at least gives off some heat as well as the dreadful light. Moon doesn't.~
@725  = ~It's better than the sun, because of the phases. The smaller the sliver, the better I like it.~
@726  = ~What of it? Same thing as the sun, just paler and smaller.~
@727  = ~Beauty?~
@728  = ~Yes. Take the starry skies, for example-~
@729  = ~Haven't you listen to the birds singing and-~
@730  = ~ Haven't you listen to the birds singing and-~
@731  = ~The spring flowers-~
@732  = ~Tiny creeks trickling under the boughs of sentient woods-~
@733  = ~Woods make me nervous. They are full of eyes, noises and stench.~
@734  = ~Those are too small to hide one's smell and hide his tracks.~
@735  = ~A water source is a beautiful thing.~
@736  = ~...and the blood flowers on the snow. I like them. They smell of victory.~
@737  = ~Summer flowers and autumn flowers... they all stink the air to the point it's difficult to breathe, and they also attract insects.~
@738  = ~I've seen those. Blinding in the sunlight, pale spots in the night.~
@739  = ~And got excited about the incessant chirping? No.~
@740  = ~Stupid is not beautiful. The dumb things give out their own location, and, even worse, they give out yours as well, the moment you come close.~
@741  = ~Yes. And ate the ones that were singing too loudly.~
@742  = ~Ah, the 'jewels above." I prefer real gems, Mistress. You can carry them, you can sell them - that's real beauty.~
@743  = ~The stars are useful. One can find his way by them, unless the moon blinds him.~
@744  = ~A mess of small, twinkling points.~
@745  = ~(Rizdaer startles, but nothing in his face belies if he anticipated your touch, or if he is pleased or displeased by it.)~
@746  = ~If you don't need anything, I'd rather you- ~
@747  = ~(Shakes his head as if chasing away some thought.) I'd rather you left me to my business.~
@748  = ~(Rizdaer's arm tenses under your touch and you can feel the muscle turning to iron.)~
@749  = ~Don't tap me on the shoulder-~
@750  = ~Ah. It is you, Mistress. ~
@751  = ~(He drinks of your wine, for once taking something from you without a retort, without a single word. His eyes are downcast, but you can see the tension in his temples, his fingers, and his mouth.)~
@752  = ~You don't mean to poison-. No. You don't. Of course you don't.~
@753  = ~I think I'd rather go now and pretend that this conversation never happened.~
@754  = ~(Rizdaer takes a small sip, and smiles briskly.) I won't have more. I need a clear head to fight for you, Mistress.~
@755  = ~From your own skin? You honor me, Mistress. ~
@756  = ~I am. Drow breed for beauty... and females.~
@757  = ~It helps, I suppose, that my coloring doesn't send you fleeing and screaming: 'drow!'~
@758  = ~You've never seen me as I truly am, without all these dyes. (He takes a disgusted look at the back of his hand.)~
@759  = ~I'm elated that my appearance pleases my Mistress.~
@760  = ~Not too handsome, luckily. It spells early death in female's quarrels over the choice breeding piece for a drow male. ~
@761  = ~I don't know why I am telling you this.~
@762  = ~Hide it.~
@763  = ~Why's that?~
@764  = ~To avoid being tortured and sacrificed to Lolth.~
@765  = ~Right.~
@766  = ~But why?~
@767  = ~Don't drow females find a male's attention flattering?~
@768  = ~This is horrible!~
@769  = ~I don't believe you. ~
@770  = ~I'm glad that it pleases you.~
@771  = ~No. Being a drow here isn't better than being a male there.~
@772  = ~I want to be left alone, and nothing else.~
@773  = ~When your life is worth nothing, and will never be more, you do what you have to in order to live. And those who say they would rather die, lie.~
@774  = ~I saw drunken idiots that would be licking latrines with their tongues to avoid the merest punishment boasting of that. When your life is worth nothing, and will never be, you do what you have to in order to live. And them who say they would rather die, lie.~
@775  = ~My deepest apologies, Mistress.~
@776  = ~It is.~
@777  = ~You can court a woman if you want to.~
@778  = ~Do you like it better here? ~
@779  = ~I'm glad you realize that.~
@780  = ~You don't believe me? Is it because you think that no surface man would live like that?~
@781  = ~No, it's because your whining tires me.~
@782  = ~Well, yes...~
@783  = ~Before I met you, I would have said 'yes'. But you are strong, Rizdaer, very strong. Yet, you never rebelled. So, I assume that it is near impossible to do.~
@784  = ~Anything she wishes. Mates him, probably. Fights the one who owns him if he's taken. Kills him if she can't have him.~
@785  = ~That's... illuminating. ~
@786  = ~I've heard enough.~
@787  = ~Well, here, on the surface, it's different.~
@788  = ~It's a serious trespass to attempt to attract the attention of a disinterested female. It implies that a male has an ability to choose, to prefer. Which is an aberration.~
@789  = ~All right. So what a female does when she likes a male?~
@790  = ~Usstan ssinssrigg dos. This is the last thing you'll hear or say in the Underdark.~
@791  = ~The nearest thing to it translates loosely as 'I'm a fool.'~
@792  = ~*I* don't say it.~
@793  = ~There is no word for love in drow.~
@794  = ~(He bows low) Your wish is my command, Mistress.~
@795  = ~On your knees, worm!~
@796  = ~Kiss my feet.~
@797  = ~Feh, I'm bored.~
@798  = ~You made me wait, male. (Slap)~
@799  = ~(Squeeze Rizdaer's bottom)~
@800  = ~Will you truly do *anything* I say?~
@801  = ~Compared to a surface male, you have no dignity. Actually, a *slug* has more dignity than you.~
@802  = ~I'm pleased with you.~
@803  = ~You have one job in this party as far as I'm concerned. Do it.~
@804  = ~I'm not satisfied. This was amusing, but I want you to love me. To truly love me.~
@805  = ~(Rizdaer gives you a strange, blank look.) I will not betray you, Mistress, I swear. Punish me, if you have to, torture me, but I am yours.~
@806  = ~Your wants are mine.~
@807  = ~Not since I was fortunate enough to enter your service, Mistress.~
@808  = ~To die in your service, Mistress.~
@809  = ~(He stands still, seemingly unsure about what to do regarding your fingers touching his face.)~
@810  = ~I like this sort of a slap to the face. (Covers your hand with his and holds it for a moment. An almost-smile curves his lips.)~
@811  = ~(The ointment Rizdaer used to lighten his skin bleached the rich ebony to dusky grey. He looks much like an elf now.) ~
@812  = ~(Rizdaer's face is lean, even for his own kind. Perhaps it's due to tension and alertness, readiness for something... unpleasant, that are ever-present in the man.)~
@813  = ~(Deep bow.)~
@814  = ~I'll always do your bidding the best I can.~
@815  = ~I'm glad to hear it - I was told a few times that surfacers are different from drow, but I was right. There is no real difference.~
@816  = ~I live to serve.~
@817  = ~(Or, more exactly, I live while I serve)~
@818  = ~I can give you one as a gift, if you miss this fine quality in me.~
@819  = ~A pity you think so.~
@820  = ~You must decide if you despise or approve, Mistress.~
@821  = ~You'll have to point out a slug to me, so I can fully appreciate the insult.~
@822  = ~I doubt that a surfacer can ask something that a drow cannot, or will not, do.~
@823  = ~I'll not risk your displeasure.~
@824  = ~You sound bewildered. Have I disobeyed yet, Mistress?~
@825  = ~(Only a slightly more rigid cast to his shoulders tells you that Rizdaer noticed you approach and your playful gesture. Perhaps he interprets it as punishment and is determined to be stoic. Or something of the kind. You don't know much of the internal workings of this dark soul.)~
@826  = ~Aye-ay-ay!~
@827  = ~If that's not the reaction you're looking for, please let your humble lover know what it is that you wish him do. ~
@828  = ~Shall I turn to offer you another cheek, Mistress?~
@829  = ~(You'll have to try harder next time. It's one ironclad behind!)~
@830  = ~(Strangely, the lovers' caress feels like a mark of possession, rather than passion.)~
@831  = ~Why bother yourself, Mistress, when you could have whistled?~
@832  = ~You honor me, Mistress.~
@833  = ~(The drow's lips under yours are warm, and noticeably roughened by weather.)~
@834  = ~(His jaw tightens) It will not happen again, Mistress.~
@835  = ~(Deep bow.) I beg your to be merciful.~
@836  = ~If I didn't turn faster to your call, Mistress, it was because I checked that no stray arrow was going to interrupt us.~
@837  = ~(Rizdaer doesn't blink as you watch the imprint of your palm appear, and then fade on his cheek.)~
@838  = ~Things can never be simple with women.~
@839  = ~Surfacers employ the strangest ways to do things.~
@840  = ~You'll need to guide me. 'True love' is something that I can't even translate into Drow.~
@841  = ~Mistress, I'll do what I must to please you. ~
@842  = ~Then get a companion spider, Mistress. A female can spend hours watching it weave the webs without growing bored.~
@843  = ~There's no whip in our packs, ilharess.~
@844  = ~I await only your command to pleasure you.~
@845  = ~Forgive me, Mistress.~
@846  = ~(Rizdaer leads you away, not for a moment forgetting to scout for attackers, until you are sheltered from both unfriendly and too friendly eyes. In that little haven, on haphazardly thrown cloaks, you entwine and pulse with your obedient lover.)~
@847  = ~(Rizdaer runs his hands through your hair, and his thumbs find a particular spot behind your ears. The light massage is not erotic in nature, but his closeness is.)~
@848  = ~(Whatever it was, the clearest memory of it is the renewed bite mark on your shoulder.)~
@849  = ~(Rizdaer's deft fingers find a way to ascend the two hills and camp on the top for a moment.)~
@850  = ~(Rizdaer does some outrageous things with his tongue... Outrageous, decadent, forbiddeeeeee.......)~
@851  = ~(He leans over and simply strokes and kisses your neck. Why should it make you shiver only gods and drow know.)~
@852  = ~(Rizdaer presses your back against his chest, and lets his palms run loose on your hips, making maddeningly slow progress toward the middle.)~
@853  = ~(Wordlessly, the drow comes over, takes you in his arms and explores your mouth with his. There's a moment, a very short moment when a slave turns into a hungry man, but it's so short-lived, that it could have been a figment of your imagination.)~
@854  = ~Forgive me, Mistress. I've neglected my duty while we were fighting. (Rizdaer attends to kissing with the enthusiasm of a guilty man seeking pardon.)~
@855  = ~Allow me to try it the surfacer's way. (He takes your hand and kisses it as respectfully as any knight would have. Well, a little too respectfully, actually.)~
@856  = ~(Rizdaer readily takes your face into his palms and kisses you on the lips with skill, but little else.)~
@857  = ~(He solemnly takes your footwear off and sets the sole of your foot on top of his head, then slides it down, so that your toes come to rest against his forehead. He shifts your foot slightly once more and his lips land on your heel. It tickles!)~
@858  = ~(Rizdaer kneels in front of you and strokes your knee then kisses it. Next time his lips find purchase slightly lower. Again and again his mouth descends, until it stops at the tip of your big toe.)~
@859  = ~Ten kisses, Mistress. One for your every toe.~
@860  = ~(Bow silently)~
@861  = ~Mistress, would you permit me do this after I washed your feet for the night?~
@862  = ~Hmm, alright, but don't you dare speaking without permission again.~
@863  = ~(Pout) Oh, have it your way, but then I shall double the amount.~
@864  = ~No, you will kiss my feet now.~
@865  = ~(Rizdaer prostrates himself at your feet, and deferentially kisses the toe of your boot)~
@866  = ~(Rizdaer kneels, but shoots you a defiant look from under his tresses.) Will that be all?~
@867  = ~(He genuflects, catching the edge of your cloak, then bows his head to kiss it. You can see his fingers tighten on the fabric.)~
@868  = ~(Anger? Desire? Frustration? Tenderness?)~
@869  = ~(When you look into his face, it's emotionless.~
@870  = ~(Rizdaer drops to his knees as if hamstrung. For a space of a heartbeat, he appears stunned.)~
@871  = ~(chuckle) Was it fast enough, my Mistress?~
@872  = ~Ilharess. (Rizdaer kneels in front of you with unmistakable elven grace. His eyes are focused on your feet. In all probability he'll neither rise, nor look up, until ordered.)~
@873  = ~(Nods).~
@874  = ~Look, everyone, these two are going to 'scout ahead' again. Hey, do spend some time actually scouting this time around. I mean, last time you got back saying the coast was clear and what happened next?! We were swarmed! It's a wonder you two didn't get killed while on your own.~
@875  = ~This is disturbing, yet so.... I wish I knew what drives you.~
@876  = ~Have a pleasant ride. Ah, I meant 'a walk' of course, seeing we don't have stallions... of a four-legged sort at least.~
@877  = ~I do not be understanding why you would be preferring to put your lives and our quest in danger.~
@878  = ~Night is just not long enough for you, lass? Not my bloody business, I suppose, but your Lord Father will be cross.~
@879  = ~No... no... control. (Deep breath in). No... no restraint at all!~
@880  = ~Young love, and all that. Uh, I wonderin' what they'd be usin' for rings? A couple of the useless rubbish we found could be reforged quite nicely. It won't be the real thin' of course, but still very nice.~
@881  = ~(Chuckles) As they say, 'love levels the mountains and dries out the seas.'~
@882  = ~The call of nature, mmgh?~
@883  = ~ Thank you kind sir, I'm glad you care.~
@884  = ~Your rhyme is dire, us poets despair.~
@885  = ~It's not the rhyme that you can't bear!~
@886  = ~Yes. It's your stupidity beyond repair.~
@887  = ~That you're jealous I am aware!~
@888  = ~How often does your imagination flare?~
@889  = ~All the time! So, prepare!~
@890  = ~I'm not in the mood, go flirt elsewhere.~
@891  = ~Aha! And why would you care?~
@892  = ~May I suggest a tarrasque's lair?~
@893  = ~You don't need to ask me twice!~
@894  = ~Really, really? For true this time?! All right, but try to be nice!~
@895  = ~You... what? Whom?! Oh.... Okay.~
@896  = ~Heh, good luck to you, pirate. I bet she eats your kind for breakfast, lunch, with her afternoon tea and at supper!~
@897  = ~Friends is nice, I suppose. Still, it's kind of annoying.~
@898  = ~Well, you see, *I* think good things about people, until they prove to be jerks!~
@899  = ~Tee-hee!~
@900  = ~You are an incredible companion, P! Why, I'd even say phantasmagoric! ~
@901  = ~How are you doing there, Peony? ~
@902  = ~Peony, can we walk together for a bit?~
@903  = ~(Pinch Peony.)~
@904  = ~(Wink at Peony.)~
@905  = ~Peony, your hair-~
@906  = ~(Smile at Peony.)~
@907  = ~(Tweak Peony's nose.)~
@908  = ~(Start composing a song in her honor: 'Peony, you're a maid most fair...')~
@909  = ~(Take Peony's hand.)~
@910  = ~Peony, I love another. I love Jaemal.~
@911  = ~Peony, I love another. I love Salomeya.~
@912  = ~Our relationship... Peony, I don't want to hurt you, but I'd like us to remain friends, and nothing more.~
@913  = ~Peony, you little pest! Can't you get it that I don't like you?!~
@914  = ~Peony, I'm not trying to push you away, but I'd like a bit less attention. Perhaps, if we stop flirting, it would be better.~
@915  = ~Have you just clued into it, silly? Wow, you're a tiny bit slow.~
@916  = ~Tra-la-la-la- What? What did you just say?~
@917  = ~Sheesh, you're lucky to have me! Uhm... as a companion that is.~
@918  = ~And you'd be damn right! I'm incredible!~
@919  = ~I'm fine!~
@920  = ~Oh, it's the height of summer here! The flowers are all in bloom, and butterflies in ridiculous quantities chase after me.~
@921  = ~Not bad at all! I'd sing a cheerful trail song if that was wise.~
@922  = ~Or if my throat wasn't sore after doing it the other day.~
@923  = ~I'm a bit bored, a bit hungry, and my feet are seriously cold.~
@924  = ~Nope! Absolutely not!~
@925  = ~What?! A daft question deserves a daft answer, you know.~
@926  = ~Of course! I love chatting with you!~
@927  = ~(Looks up at you, curious.) And since when have you been asking my permission to do it? It's strange, but er... yep, strange.~
@928  = ~Hey, last time I looked, there were no laws prohibiting one to walk near me.~
@929  = ~(Peony purses her lips and gives you her best haughty stare.) That was *not* funny, Mister.~
@930  = ~One day I'm going to invent Peony's Pinch and Tickle Spell that will obliterate foes! Hey, if they have to die, at least they'd die in the throes of laughter. Battles would be much more fun!~
@931  = ~Oh, you're going to SUFFER for it! (Peony attacks you, breathless with laughter, trying to pinch you just about anywhere!)~
@932  = ~(Peony's eyes fill with tears as she presses her palm to the pinched spot.) Oi-oi-oi!~
@933  = ~He-he-he! I knew you'd buy it!~
@934  = ~(Giggles.) You look like an owl who got spooked into bright daylight!~
@935  = ~(Winks back at you, looking adorably sly and mischievous.)~
@936  = ~Oh, yes, I completely forgot about - Wait, no, that can't be right. I couldn't have planned painting your face red and white while you sleep *with* you... Oh, damn.~
@937  = ~Stop it! You're making me feel itchy.~
@938  = ~(She leans her head to one side, making her hair run down to her shoulder in a cascade of shiny blue.)~
@939  = ~I know! It's phantasmagoric!~
@940  = ~-is mine, though it looks just like Lady Alustriel's. Neat!~
@941  = ~-is divine, and if you didn't mean to say that you better pretend you were!~
@942  = ~(Peony makes a funny face.) Yep. On we go...~
@943  = ~(She claps her hands.) Hey, do you know that you smile up at me more often than at any other person? I *counted*!~
@944  = ~You should smile more often. It suits you!~
@945  = ~(Peony smiles back at you. If she's normally pretty, her smile makes her into a veritable beauty, lighting up her face and setting the sparkles of laughter to dance in her eyes.)~
@946  = ~Heh, you're so naughty!~
@947  = ~I like it!~
@948  = ~Ah' 'uo goin' t'let go?~
@949  = ~Ouuff! So much better. Sheesh, if you're not careful, I'm going to have a trunk! I mean, the bigger nose, the prettier, but at some point it's bound to get ridiculous.~
@950  = ~Hey, slow down! How'd you feel if I tweaked *your* nose all the time?! ~
@951  = ~Oh! Let's see!~
@952  = ~Got it!~
@953  = ~Hmm... You'll have to lean forward, so I can reach for it!~
@954  = ~Tee-hee! I have the best nose this side of the Spine of the World!~
@955  = ~How nice! What's next?~
@956  = ~Uhm, that's er... that's all I've got so far.~
@957  = ~Let's go, or the rest will stare!~
@958  = ~T'wards others I must repair... ~
@959  = ~Maybe... a glass of wine we can share?~
@960  = ~I'd kiss you but I do not dare... ~
@961  = ~As the sun goes down, will you meet me somewhere? ~
@962  = ~My undying love for you I swear! ~
@963  = ~Your beauty is beyond compare. ~
@964  = ~Huh, that's all I wanted to share.~
@965  = ~Er... 'To tell how I feel about you I don't dare....' ~
@966  = ~You've sparkling eyes, and uh...striking hair!~
@967  = ~Surely, men for you... would danger dare! ~
@968  = ~And your bounty is enough and to spare.~
@969  = ~Just being near you is a pleasant affair.~
@970  = ~And skillful you are with verve and flair.~
@971  = ~When you walk by, men stop and stare.~
@972  = ~To a spring day I will thou compare. ~
@973  = ~A precious jewel, a gem most rare! ~
@974  = ~Too bad your nose is big as a pear!~
@975  = ~At least compared to yonder mare. ~
@976  = ~But your robes are torn, your arse now bare. ~
@977  = ~So long as you shave off all the hair? ~
@978  = ~Words sweet to mine ear, I declare!~
@979  = ~Whoa! You're moving too fast, cavalier!~
@980  = ~Oh... I think they would!~
@981  = ~(Twists around and grabs at her robe...) He-he-he! Not even the slightest tear! Now, if you had your lacing disintegrated and your breeches falling down in the middle of a battle, that would have been funny!~
@982  = ~Or it *will* be as soon as I work out a way to get it done without killing you in the process. Though I'd be willing to try it regardless, I think...~
@983  = ~You go sing to her, and you'll be choosing above yourself!~
@984  = ~Lock up your sons, mothers beware! Too late for your mom!~
@985  = ~Heh, I should have guessed that you'd insert a gem somewhere, kinsman.~
@986  = ~Tee-hee! Uhm, not bad for a pirate, that's what I meant to say.~
@987  = ~Wow, that's so true!~
@988  = ~Why's that? You better not be thinking some bad things about me, Mister!~
@989  = ~No, no! Only the good things, Miss!~
@990  = ~I'm not. I'm... just shy. ~
@991  = ~Forget it. I shouldn't have started this-~
@992  = ~(Sticks her tongue at you.) It's too late for regrets! And I know you didn't mean anything untoward.~
@993  = ~I know! Heh, you're such a sweetheart.~
@994  = ~Oh, how sweet. Thanks!~
@995  = ~My... what?!  Hey, you better not be thinking what I think you are thinking.~
@996  = ~Well, it's not bad at all. You let me know when you write more of it.~
@997  = ~Says who? A big stinky bear!~
@998  = ~So what?! I don't care!~
@999  = ~How come your hands are so warm? I keep getting glass-fingers here. I swear, I have to breathe on them before casting almost every time to get them moving.~
@1000 = ~I'll try to hold your hands more often then.~
@1001 = ~We'll get you nice, big fur gloves, Peony. ~
@1002 = ~That would explain why your spells come *after* all the fighting is done. ~
@1003 = ~They do NOT! Pfft.~
@1004 = ~Uhm, I don't know about that. See, woolens are better, because I don't have to think about the poor rabbit or  squirrel that died for me to have them. I mean, shearing must be unpleasant for the sheep, but it's not as lethal as being skinned.~
@1005 = ~Hey, that's a great idea!~
@1006 = ~Excuse me, Mister?! I'm not that kind of girl! Besides, I can't cast spells very well if you clutch my pinkie, can I?~
@1007 = ~Sheesh, I didn't know that pirates go around hand in hand!~
@1008 = ~All the time.~
@1009 = ~(Wink) It's a cover-up.~
@1010 = ~But we're not pirates.~
@1011 = ~Are you a pirate?!~
@1012 = ~No, silly, not *me*. You! You're from Luskan, and everybody knows that Luskaners are all pirates.~
@1013 = ~*We* are not, but you surely are.~
@1014 = ~So the rest won't guess, right? I'm game, mate! (She squeezes your hand in her soft, slightly plump one.)~
@1015 = ~Oh, how exciting! (She giggles and doesn't remove her hand.)~
@1016 = ~(Peony looks up at you with delight.)~
@1017 = ~Oh, dashing pirate!~
@1018 = ~(Sing a song.)~
@1019 = ~(Glance Peony's way.)~
@1020 = ~(Play with her hair.)~
@1021 = ~Hey, Peony, this pinecone looks like a peony flower!~
@1022 = ~(Tickle Peony.)~
@1023 = ~I love you, Peony.~
@1024 = ~(Lift Peony off the ground and swirl her around.)~
@1025 = ~(Hug Peony.)~
@1026 = ~(Kiss Peony.)~
@1027 = ~(Rub noses with Peony.)~
@1028 = ~You should sing more often, pirate. And dance. Not that we have much time for it, but you are sooo good at it!~
@1029 = ~(Peony joins in enthusiastically, trying her best to turn the song into a lover's duet, sometimes overdoing it with a melodramatic show of emotions and sometimes getting it just right.)~
@1030 = ~If that's a serenade, I want my balcony, and, to think of it, the palace adjacent to it too, and a warm southern night!~
@1031 = ~Hey, I'm glad to see you in good spirit!~
@1032 = ~(Peony lifts her considerable nose up to the sky, purposely ignoring you.)~
@1033 = ~(It takes two heartbeats for her to dismiss the Miss Unattainable persona and clap you on the shoulder.)~
@1034 = ~(She waves.) We're almost there, tee-hee!~
@1035 = ~(Peony is whistling something happily under her nose, but she seems to feel your glance. The moment your eyes meet, hers light up with laughter and mischief.)~
@1036 = ~(A heartwarming smile greets you.)~
@1037 = ~(As you muss up her hair, Peony tries to keep a semblance of order, but it only leads to a wilder look.)~
@1038 = ~(Finally, she draws away from you and shakes her head vigorously. Incredibly, her mane returns to the glorious, neatly arranged and sophisticated hairdo she always sports.) Good enchantment, huh?~
@1039 = ~You know, I am wondering how our hair would look all mixed up... oh. ~
@1040 = ~(She blushes deeply.) I mean, the colors and... and....~
@1041 = ~(Peony closes her eyes and smiles widely.) If I could purr, I would!~
@1042 = ~(Soft and silky, the blue strands run through your fingers.)~
@1043 = ~You call this a peony? (Winks.)~
@1044 = ~*That's* a peony. (The brown, shriveled cone in your hands turns into a fragrant luscious bloom. In the very middle of the mass of loose petals, you can discern a laughing face of one gnomish illusionist you know.)~
@1045 = ~Oh, truly? Here... (She clips the cone on a thin golden chain she wears around her neck. It's likely to fall away soon and get lost, but Peony seems very particular about having it there for the moment.)~
@1046 = ~(Peony takes the cone from you and gives it a critical look.) Nah. Have you even seen a peony? If you come with me to Silverymoon, my first cousin three times removed has a whole garden of them. Her name's Astra.~
@1047 = ~(She stuffs the pinecone into your pocket like a little squirrel.) Keep it... for luck.~
@1048 = ~(At first Peony struggles and tries to give back as much as she receives, but then, exhausted with laughter, she sinks in your arms letting you hold all of her weight. )~
@1049 = ~Catch me if you can! (Peony manages to wrestle free and sticks a tongue out at you from a safe distance, poised to take off like the wind and run for her life. )~
@1050 = ~Oi-oi-oi! (Peony wriggles in your arms like a slippery fish.)~
@1051 = ~(Peony makes a small grimace.) You're acting like a baby!~
@1052 = ~Oh, you're such a pirate! Quick to anger, quick to love! (Peony pats you on the back.)~
@1053 = ~(When she smiles like that, two dimples appear on her cheeks.)~
@1054 = ~It's nice to hear.~
@1055 = ~Wow, now that came like a bolt out of the blue! (Wink.)~
@1056 = ~I love you too!~
@1057 = ~Ouf! That reminds me of that time when I read the Wall of Wind scroll!~
@1058 = ~You see, I didn't want to be discovered, so I thought I'd cast it inside a chest. Well, it tore the lid right off!~
@1059 = ~(Peony's unusual hair and the skirts of her robes become airborne with the motion, but she doesn't seem to care.)~
@1060 = ~(As you set her on the ground, she takes your hands into hers, sets her little booted feet, and leads you into a few more mad, whirling circles.)~
@1061 = ~(Squinting with pleasure, she throws her head back and laughs in an excited, tinkling way.)~
@1062 = ~Whoa! Oh, please, do it again! Pretty please?~
@1063 = ~(Peony nestles herself in your arms.)~
@1064 = ~Ahh, can we just... stay here?~
@1065 = ~You're not getting away with just a hug, Mister!~
@1066 = ~Kiss! Kiss! Ki... (A huge kiss.)~
@1067 = ~(She presses her cheek against your chest and sighs contentedly.)~
@1068 = ~Boom. Boom. Boom. I like your heartbeat!~
@1069 = ~(Peony throws her arms around your neck and looks up at you with shiny eyes.)~
@1070 = ~Mmgh...sweet! ~
@1071 = ~Heh, I wonder are there any salty kisses? Aha, I know! The kisses when lovers part. Tears and kisses, that's got to taste salty. Not that I want to sample it!~
@1072 = ~Must you distract me with this foolishness when I am trying so hard to stay *focused*?!~
@1073 = ~You bet! Being focused is waaaay too boring!~
@1074 = ~(Giggles.) You can't stop at just one!~
@1075 = ~Oh! You're such a good kisser!~
@1076 = ~Almost, almo- (Peony stops to breathe for a heart-beat.)~
@1077 = ~Nope, that's not it. Your poor little nose... (She strokes it gently with her finger.)~
@1078 = ~Sweetie, you're never going to get it right. Your nose is just too tiny. Why won't you stick with what you do best?~
@1079 = ~(She kisses you on the lips.) See, you're such a good kisser!~
@1080 = ~I'll let you know that this is a special Gnomish caress, and you're doing it all wrong - But, huh, who cares!~
@1081 = ~(She takes your face between her palms and tries to show you just how it should be done: from the tip of the nose, down to the cheek.)~
@1082 = ~You know, Grandma said that it's not the same with a non-gnome, but it sure feels nice!~
@1083 = ~(She squints with pleasure.) I can feel how strong your love is, just like Grandma said I would... Wow!~
@1084 = ~Hurray! I wondered when we come to good old-fashioned nose rubbing!~
@1085 = ~I can close my eyes and pretend that we're on Lantan.~
@1086 = ~Oh, sweetie, you're just so... sweet! All those non-gnomes would never understand...~
@1087 = ~I didn't expect you to be that traditional, heh!~
@1088 = ~Oh, sweetie!~
@1089 = ~(Find Peony's hand and gently squeeze her fingers.) ~
@1090 = ~You brighten my life. ~
@1091 = ~There is nobody like you, Peony. ~
@1092 = ~You are coming closer and closer to becoming a grand wizard, just like you've always wanted. I'm very proud of you. ~
@1093 = ~Peony, is our love an illusion?~
@1094 = ~(Kiss Peony passionately.)~
@1095 = ~(Put Peony on your shoulder and carry her for a bit.)~
@1096 = ~(Peony on your shoulder and carry her for a bit.)~
@1097 = ~(Close Peony's eyes with your palms from behind.) Guess who?~
@1098 = ~(Hug Peony around her waist and pull her tightly against you.)~
@1099 = ~(Give Peony a playful slap on her bottom.)~
@1100 = ~(Kiss the top of Peony's head.)~
@1101 = ~(Cup Peony's cheek in your palm.)~
@1102 = ~Hey, Peony, this pinecone  looks like a peony flower!~
@1103 = ~(She squeezes your hand softly in turn and whispers 'I love you' almost inaudibly.)~
@1104 = ~(Her fingers are very warm and incredibly soft, even after all the time spend in the harsh clime of Icewind Dale.)~
@1105 = ~(Peony wiggles her fingers and giggles.) You can't keep this little bird a captive, Mister!~
@1106 = ~Careful, careful! That's my very valuable main casting hand!~
@1107 = ~Oh, I wonder who taught you to say all these sweet things that make my heart melt.~
@1108 = ~You... well, you didn't brighten mine, because let's face it, it was very colorful to start with, but I really like having you in it.~
@1109 = ~Really?! I thought your life was not boring... being a pirate and all!~
@1110 = ~I'm glad if I did.~
@1111 = ~Oh, thank you. I hope you meant it as a compliment!~
@1112 = ~There's none like you either. Or at least there wasn't last time I checked.~
@1113 = ~Tee-hee, you missed the good part! Nobody is sweet, beautiful and smart like me!~
@1114 = ~You bet!~
@1115 = ~Yep, and you... my, but you've grown! From the scrawny kid kicked out by his big-shot paladin dad into a real hero! You and I are just wow!~
@1116 = ~Tee-hee, I expect Mystra to show up any day now and pick me as her tenth Chosen!~
@1117 = ~You've seen nothing yet, Mister!~
@1118 = ~Oh, nice! But must you sound exactly like grandma would?~
@1119 = ~Sure, the sort where you're doomed to love me forever and ever!~
@1120 = ~Do you think that if I'm an illusionist than everything I do is an illusion, even the most importan-~
@1121 = ~He-he! Sorry, I just can't keep up this serious tirade. Sweetie, I love you, and you know your own heart better than anyone else.~
@1122 = ~I think... I think it is an illusion.~
@1123 = ~I'll have to search my feelings then. ~
@1124 = ~You do that, and be thorough! I don't like that 'Peony, did you put a spell on me'? business. Nope, I don't like it at all.~
@1125 = ~And I love you! Isn't that just grand?! And no magiking.~
@1126 = ~Not of my making, Mister Sour Face.~
@1127 = ~Tee-hee! I'll keep you guessing for the rest of our lives!~
@1128 = ~Yeeep! My very best spell!~
@1129 = ~(Peony wraps her arms around your neck.) You're wonderful... (kiss)... magnificent... (kiss)... phan- (kiss)... ta- (kiss)... sma- (kiss)... goric!!! (a very long kiss.)~
@1130 = ~Sweetie, you can't do that and just... go on with our day! I demand that we stop!~
@1131 = ~More, more, more!~
@1132 = ~Ahh!~
@1133 = ~Wow, you must be the mightiest <RACE> that ever lived!~
@1134 = ~It kind of looks silly, but I like it anyway.~
@1135 = ~Steady... steady... steady....~
@1136 = ~Psst... You really don't have to do it, sweetie. I love you even if you are not a storm giant.~
@1137 = ~Wow, you're all muscles and raw strength!~
@1138 = ~Oh, your kin is so strong, it almost scares me!~
@1139 = ~Tee-hee! I'm sitting high, I'm looking far!~
@1140 = ~Wee!~
@1141 = ~A will o' wisp with four hands and a long striped tail!~
@1142 = ~Its got to be a Chimera with a big red bow around her left neck!~
@1143 = ~A green-eyed Turmish slave girl with bells on her anklets?~

@1145 = ~(Peony immediately sets her little feet on top of yours.)~
@1146 = ~Here we go, now you can do the walking for me!~
@1147 = ~(Peony leans her head back until she's able to look into your face and gives you a bright smile.)~
@1148 = ~(Soft and rounded, her bottom rests against you.)~
@1149 = ~(Her closeness causes a pleasant warmth to spread through your body.)~
@1150 = ~That's it! I'm going to spank you tonight till you can't sit down!~
@1151 = ~Eeeeik! Careful there, I don't have a spare one!~
@1152 = ~You, Mister, are an imp!~
@1153 = ~(The petite but well-defined subject of you attentions moves promptly out of reach.)~
@1154 = ~Mmgh... I really like the way you breathe.~
@1155 = ~Oh! Soooo sweet...~
@1156 = ~(Your lips are mercilessly tickled as you finish the kiss.)~
@1157 = ~(Your nose and lips submerge into the warm flowery midst of her hair and the cold, unforgiving outside world retreats for a moment.)~
@1158 = ~(She giggles.) How can such big hands be so gentle? It's some sort of a natural mystery.~
@1159 = ~(She covers your hand with hers.) You're so cute!~
@1160 = ~(Peony gives the base of your thumb a couple of tender kisses.)~
@1161 = ~(She rubs her cheek against your palm a bit and smiles dreamily.)~
@1162 = ~Pardon me?~
@1163 = ~Darling, I've never doubted that you continue to adore me. That you have been doing so quietly was to your advantage, really.~
@1164 = ~How pathetic is that? But of course, darling, go ahead. He'd let you mount him easily enough, after all it's his only chance.~
@1165 = ~If you are willing to associate with this brat, there is no helping you, darling. You two deserve one another.~
@1166 = ~Out of all the pathetic ways to save face you had to choose the quintessential one.~

@1168 = ~(Salomeya is murmuring some tune sotto voice, with a mocking smile on her lips.)~
@1169 = ~Have you ever praised someone?~
@1170 = ~Do you ever tire of being a bitch?~
@1171 = ~Why do you think you're so darn special?~
@1172 = ~What do you think of me?~
@1173 = ~Sing for me, Salomeya.~
@1174 = ~You're such a tease! I'm sure that you like me.~
@1175 = ~Please, stop pushing me away. I want to help you overcome your bitterness.~
@1176 = ~I think you deserve a good spanking.~
@1177 = ~(Scowl at Salomeya.)~
@1178 = ~(Glance at Salomeya.)~
@1179 = ~(Ogle Salomeya and whistle approvingly.)~
@1180 = ~(Watch Salomeya brush her hair.)~
@1181 = ~(Take Salomeya's hand.)~
@1182 = ~I like your style. ~
@1183 = ~Salomeya, I love another. I love Jaemal.~
@1184 = ~Salomeya, I love another. I love Peony.~
@1185 = ~Our relationship... Salomeya, I don't want to hurt you, but I'd like us to remain friends, and nothing more.~
@1186 = ~I've had have enough of you, snake! Don't you dare sink your poisonous teeth into me again, or I'll pull them out.~
@1187 = ~Salomeya, I'm not trying to push you away, but I'd like a bit less attention. Perhaps, if we stop flirting, it would be better.~
@1188 = ~(She shrugs carelessly.) I suppose that next I'll be applauded by yetis.~
@1189 = ~Of course you do. It requires a certain level of sophistication, but it's not so taxing as to limit the audience... too much. Alas, in this wasteland even a modicum of refinement is too much to ask for.~
@1190 = ~You, and an army of my admirers.~
@1191 = ~Congratulations, you are less of a fool than I credited you for.~
@1192 = ~(They are a musician's hands, with long, elegant, but strong fingers. Pampered, with brightly painted nails and not a single scratch breaking the smooth, silky skin.)~
@1193 = ~Oh, please. Are we two farmers on a fair day? Holding hands! Next you'll start smiling sheepishly.~
@1194 = ~No, no, this will not do at all: my beautiful hands in your... grubby paws. Scrub them clean, rub away those calluses, and then I might consider letting you to hold my hand.~
@1195 = ~(She doesn't immediately take her hand from you. The delay is perfect. It allows you to just start feeling the warmth and smoothness of her skin interrupted only by the cold touch of her bracelets and rings, but not quite, not quite...)~
@1196 = ~(As her hand escapes slowly, you are granted the final touch of her long fingernails... and then it's done, and you hold Salomeya's hand no more.)~
@1197 = ~(Salomeya just finished brushing her hair 'till it shines'. She slowly leans her head backward, and the strands fan themselves across her shoulders, cloaking her to the waist, the red silk of her hair on the red silk of her dress.)~
@1198 = ~(She lifts her head up slowly, opens her eyes and looks directly at you.) Amused, little one?~
@1199 = ~One day when I'm bored or benevolent enough I'll let you brush it for me.~
@1200 = ~(Red and golden, the strands part and come together again, like rippling water... or blood.)~
@1201 = ~(Salomeya counts the strokes religiously as an ivory comb makes its way through the smooth red silk of her mane.)~
@1202 = ~Once you're done making a fool out of yourself, darling, do come over. I need to relace my boot, and your back would serve nicely as a bench.~
@1203 = ~(Salomeya looks you up and down with the eyes of a horse-dealer. But she doesn't whistle, pursing her lips instead in a 'so-so' gesture.)~
@1204 = ~(Salomeya completely and entirely ignores your attentions. No self-conscious gripping of skirts, no nervous adjustment of an earring, no pushing at an invisible hair... Nothing.)~
@1205 = ~Oh, poor dear. To be that unused to the company of beautiful women!~
@1206 = ~(Unlike many other half-elves, Salomeya seems to emphasize the fact that she's of mixed blood.)~
@1207 = ~(The roundness of her shoulders, and the soft fullness of her bosom that are alien to the angular elven builds... but sharp tilt and the bright, true color of her eyes, unknown among humans... she's dressed and made up to attract attention to these, to tease the viewer, to leave him guessing and sorting apart feature after feature... and to come to the inevitable conclusion that the combination is perfect and unique.)~
@1208 = ~(Sideways, Salomeya's features seem to be made of fine white porcelain, with red-gold hair and brow, and coal black eyelashes around an emerald eye. The illusion of an object of art is so complete, that it stirs a desire to own this statuesque head, this perfect thing of beauty.)~
@1209 = ~(Your eyes meet and Salomeya raises her brow questionongly.)~
@1210 = ~(Drop your eyes.)~
@1211 = ~(Turn away, trying to create the impression that you were just surveying the surroundings.)~
@1212 = ~(Meet her gaze levelly.)~
@1213 = ~You're a pleasure to look upon, bard.~
@1214 = ~(Stare, mesmerized, at the bright line of her brow and bewitching eyes.)~
@1215 = ~(She snaps her fingers in front of your face and turns away in a cascade of flowing silks.) ~
@1216 = ~Perhaps I should start charging for looking, hmm?~
@1217 = ~(Salomeya's lips form a brief half-smile, then she stops paying attention to you.)~
@1218 = ~(Salomeya chuckles softly, throatily.)~
@1219 = ~(Salomeya's robes are anything but bulky. The lustrous silks cling and run loose, like a trained plant, revealing the shape of her bosom and narrow waist, but draping her hips and arms in generous folds.)~
@1220 = ~Hmm... This feral facet of yours, it's low brow and disgusting, of course, but it does convey some... hmm... primeval statement. ~
@1221 = ~Tsk, tsk... Try not to do that if we ever go to a civilized place - a small possibility, mind, but still. I'd be ashamed to be associated with you.~
@1222 = ~What's next? Growling? Eating raw enemy hearts? Oh, Beshaba, but men are barbaric around these parts.~
@1223 = ~If you think that -or *anything* including the strongest dwarven spirits- would make you prettier in my eyes, you're very much mistaken.~
@1224 = ~If there's any spanking to be done between the two of us, I'll be the one dealing it out, trust me.~
@1225 = ~Ever a fool... (Sigh.)~
@1226 = ~Is that what daddy paladin did to our little hero when he was a bad? And even that didn't teach him how not to shit his pants.~
@1227 = ~Do dream on, boy. You won't catch me with my smallclothes down no matter how much you want to.~
@1228 = ~Is this where I weep on your chest were we in a second rate play by some talentless hack?~
@1229 = ~Ah, but it's lucky we're not. If I were you, I'd start skipping with joy, because your type ever dies midway through those things.~
@1230 = ~Was I ever pushing you? *This* is pushing. (She pushes you out of her way and storms off.)~
@1231 = ~Tsk, tsk. There's just no helping some people. I mean you.~
@1232 = ~By Beshaba, it sounded almost ironic! I wish it had, so you wouldn't come across as such a pillock.~
@1233 = ~Like is a word for virgins and cripples. I love... or hate. Not you, though. But there's something about you that might bestir emotions. Might...~
@1234 = ~Oh, dear. You better keep that revelation secret, otherwise the others will have troubles believing your 'gut feeling' when you tell them that you feel we're going to win.~
@1235 = ~Self-deception is a formidable force.~
@1236 = ~You're sure? Really? (Barely containing laughter.) Then it *must* be true.~
@1237 = ~Perhaps later... if you are a good boy and please me.~
@1238 = ~My job is to inspire in battle, not to be a music box that you can wind up and let play any time you want.~
@1239 = ~It's truly easy, boy. When I want to sing - I sing. And even someone as slow as you are can't miss when I do sing.~
@1240 = ~Indeed.~
@1241 = ~Are you... ordering me to sing? Why, those battles must have given you an erroneous sense of self-importance!~
@1242 = ~Good thing I have a bard along to remind me just how insignificant I, the hero of her tale, am...~
@1243 = ~Whatever. If you don't want to sing-~
@1244 = ~Salomeya, you have one job in this party. Do it. ~
@1245 = ~You hear enough of my divine voice when I simply say 'no'.~
@1246 = ~Give me my lute, darling... This is from 'A Cautionary Tale for the Greenhorns.'~
@1247 = ~The more I travel, the more I see
that some were simply not meant to be
adventurers...
But thank the gods for the fools and greenhorns
for they make us laugh as we go on
adventuring...~
@1248 = ~If you ain't convincing
Enough for a hen 
Or the sheep in a pen
And you went afield a-heroing
You're in the wrong business clearly
Did you try cleaning feces?~
@1249 = ~If you lack the sense
to hide away 
on a rainy day
And you went afield a-heroing
You're in the wrong business clearly
Did you try hanging off a fence?~
@1250 = ~If you lack the brains
to hold a spud
the right side up
And you went afield a-heroing
You're in the wrong business clearly
Did you try cleaning the drains?~
@1251 = ~If you lack the sleight
o'hand to open a lock for me
even when you have the key
And you went afield a-heroing
You're in the wrong business clearly
Did you try flying a kite?~
@1252 = ~If stamina is not enough
to cross your room
without panting like a dog at high noon
And you went afield a-heroing
You're in the wrong business clearly
Did you try selling snuff?~

to swat a summer fly...
no matter how hard you try

You're in the wrong bussiness clearly
Did you try making lace?~
@1254 = ~Right now you're much like your belt - one notch better than nothing.~
@1255 = ~You're so green, it's a wonder you know that not all swords are made of wood or have blunted edges.~
@1256 = ~You're a paladin's son. Only time will tell if that's a coincidence or a diagnosis.~
@1257 = ~(Salomeya doesn't deign to answer. At least not with words. But she gives you a sideways look of her witch-eyes that weighs, measures and finds lacking.)~
@1258 = ~Easy, my boy, you're going to give yourself gout if you keep on like that.~
@1259 = ~If you see the point of being ordinary, be my guest. I don't.~
@1260 = ~Oh, but I don't. I humbly agree with the world's opinion of me.~
@1261 = ~I find it amazingly fulfilling.~
@1262 = ~(Clap, clap, clap.) Congratulations, you've completed your transformation into a pompous miser who cannot take a hard and smart woman.~
@1263 = ~There are only three things that never tire me, darling: a skillful lover, fame and wit.~
@1264 = ~How very alluring to keep a man guessing!~
@1265 = ~Ah, here's the difference between us; I don't need to ask if you tire of being a fool... I just know that you find it deeply satisfying.~
@1266 = ~I assure you that should I see anything deserving, I'll string my lute and break into a song of sincere admiration.~
@1267 = ~Why, you think I consider it a sign of a personal weakness? How droll.~
@1268 = ~I'm saving praising for when I'm old and toothless.~
@1269 = ~You're looking at her, darling.~
@1270 = ~(Salomeya deigns to notice your approach.)~
@1271 = ~Have you ever fallen for a wrong man?~
@1272 = ~Were you ever young and naive?~
@1273 = ~What do you think of love at first sight?~
@1274 = ~(Kiss Salomeya's fingers.)~
@1275 = ~(Put your arm around Salomeya's waist.)~
@1276 = ~(Stroke Salomeya's back.)~
@1277 = ~(Roll a strand of Salomeya's hair around your finger.) ~
@1278 = ~(Smile at Salomeya.) ~
@1279 = ~(Look at her and roll your eyes.) ~
@1280 = ~You know, it would have been that much more impressive if your face was weathered down to a skull. Of course you'd have to die first and be raised, but it's a small price to pay for a perfect performance.~
@1281 = ~(An exasperated sigh.).~
@1282 = ~Hmm, I must have missed you being violently shaken by whatever mountain of muscle that opposed us last. A pity....~
@1283 = ~One day they'll jump out of their sockets. A hilarious sight, surely.~
@1284 = ~Hmm... now ease out of it nice and slow, while lowering your eyes... yes, yes, like this. Well done!~
@1285 = ~Ah, but you really need to practice in front of a mirror before springing that into a woman's face. Worse - a woman of taste's face.~
@1286 = ~You should try grinning next time, darling. I know that some don't know the difference between the two, but it's appreciable. A grin makes you look boyish, and the smile - sheepish.~
@1287 = ~(Salomeya returns a lazy, knowing smile.)~
@1288 = ~Well? If you sit here any longer, I'll have one very curly strand.~
@1289 = ~(For a moment it looks like she's chained to you, by a leash made of copper.)~
@1290 = ~If you pull this string I won't dance for you. You were not born to be a puppet master. I was.~
@1291 = ~You like it? Well, have it then. (She cuts off the strand with her dagger. The stub immediately disappears under the mass of glowing hair.)~
@1292 = ~(Her hair is so red and shiny that it looks like you have a ring of red gold on your finger.)~
@1293 = ~You... startled me. How did I let you behind my back without knowing you were there? Go... go away!~
@1294 = ~(She rolls her shoulders.) A bit more pressure, darling. Ah, what I would give for a good masseuse!~
@1295 = ~I'd be delighted to give you a massage later, when-.~
@1296 = ~(Pay no attention to what she's saying and continue studying her back, touching it lightly.)~
@1297 = ~It figures you need one, seeing that's how you must have earned your living - on your back.~
@1298 = ~(Apply more pressure.)~
@1299 = ~Oh, good, good... so good....~
@1300 = ~(Half-turns and winks at you.) See that you make me moan twice as loud if I ever let you under my blankets.~
@1301 = ~(Her back stiffens for a moment, then she turns to you with a disgusted little sneer.) I'll have you know that my art feeds me just fine and ever did. It's obnoxious luxury and power that can be earned the other way.~
@1302 = ~Are you hard of hearing? I said - more pressure.~
@1303 = ~(Laughs throatily.) Perhaps, perhaps... Just remember, darling, there will be work involved, not just staring at my bare shoulders.~
@1304 = ~(Her spine is straight under the silk, emerging from under it as a swan-like neck, carrying her head aristocratically high.)~
@1305 = ~(Salomeya's long, flexible back has something feline about it.)~
@1306 = ~(This resemblance intensifies when Salomeya hisses at you, apparently upset with you touching her.)~
@1307 = ~Oh dear. Your neck is sweating, no doubt from taxing your bravery.~
@1308 = ~(Salomeya seems to be content in walking by your side, circled by your arm, until you notice that she is yawning quite openly right into your face.)~
@1309 = ~(She frees herself easily and elegantly, without loosing a beat, but not before you feel the satisfying warmth of her body.)~
@1310 = ~(Her waist is so small that she must be looking like a wasp held between two fingers.)~
@1311 = ~(The narrow hand under your lips is be-ringed. You remember one of them - a delicate snake circling her middle finger for what seems a thousand times.)~
@1312 = ~(As you kiss, it prickles your skin. Salomeya whispers into your ear sweetly.) Don't worry, the poison dried out a fortnight ago, and I haven't refilled it. Yet.~
@1313 = ~(They are perfumed, a fleeting scent of some ancient longing or faith.)~
@1314 = ~(Salomeya tweaks her fingers slightly, in an unmistakable display of impatience. The little finger touches your nose.)~
@1315 = ~Darling, don't get your hopes up. That's as far as your lips are allowed.~
@1316 = ~Nice strong teeth you have there, darling.~
@1317 = ~And I think you've been dreaming about my soft pink bottom again.~
@1318 = ~You're still at it, aren't you? Mules should deify you.~
@1319 = ~Maybe that much. (She pulls out and hands you one of her red hairs.)~
@1320 = ~Our fury shall give us victory
Our fury shall burn our hearts
Our fury is our valedictory
For the enemies we shall surpass.~
@1321 = ~Here. Skip along now, skip along.~
@1322 = ~I'm writing your song. Hence sooner or later you'll have extraordinary qualities of some kind, real or imaginary. If I were you, I'd work on making them real.~
@1323 = ~By Beshaba, have you no pressing world-saving business to attend to instead of asking pointless questions?~
@1324 = ~It's a big but stupid cash cow for some bards. They sing it every time they run out of money.~
@1325 = ~Nothing. I preoccupy myself with realities and glory.~
@1326 = ~That it wanes at second sight.~
@1327 = ~Thankfully, I was spared that tragic waste of time.~
@1328 = ~As in I thought that rivers run with cream? No, darling, I grew up in the desert with a band of raiders, and knew from day one that I'd be lucky to get water.~
@1329 = ~Darling, I never stopped being young. As for being naïve, I don't see any value in it.~
@1330 = ~And wore short skirts? Of course I was, and I looked pretty in ruffles.~
@1331 = ~Darling, every man I fall for is the right one. He has to be because I love him... for something or other. That makes him perfect.~
@1332 = ~Yes, darling?~
@1333 = ~What do you dream about?~
@1334 = ~Do you want to change? ~
@1335 = ~Salomeya, can you love? ~
@1336 = ~Will you marry me?~
@1337 = ~(Touch Salomeya's face.)~
@1338 = ~(Look at Salomeya's lips longingly.)~
@1339 = ~(Take her by the shoulders and cover them and the back of her neck with kisses.) ~
@1340 = ~I... I love you crazy woman!~
@1341 = ~Crazy? Darling, you can't love 'normal'. Normal defies and condemns emotional turmoil, madness and desire that love represents.~
@1342 = ~Normal would have you living in a small house with a garden, selling buttons, brocade or something just as boring and useless.~
@1343 = ~Crazy throws you to the end of the world and gets you stuck with the most beautiful woman that you have ever seen. Hence you fall in love. Easy.~
@1344 = ~Mmgh, I dare hope you are not expecting me to jump up and gallop around yelping that I love you, waking mountain echoes to repeat this banality over and over?~
@1345 = ~I'm nearly positive that the mountains are all wrinkly from cringing every time some fool does just that.~
@1346 = ~If you want to increase the dramatic effect of the announcement, do choose something I don't know.~
@1347 = ~I'm in awe, now and forever, at how delicately you've put it.~
@1348 = ~(Salomeya laughs throatily.) Such fervor.~
@1349 = ~(Salomeya starts trembling slightly in your arms, leaning on you, growing warmer, closer...)~
@1350 = ~No. (Like a spooked bird she flies away from you.)~
@1351 = ~(The bright shawl that was covering those marble shoulders slides down, falling to your feet.)~
@1352 = ~(She leans her head forward, her hair rolling away with the motion, opening new uncharted territory to your lips.)~
@1353 = ~Strong men don't plead they take... though why am I even bothering to tell you this, I don't know.~
@1354 = ~Come and kiss me if you dare.~
@1355 = ~Thanks, but I'll pass.~
@1356 = ~(Walk over, take Salomeya firmly by the shoulders, kiss her deeply and swipe her into a semi-inclined position on your arm in a dance-like passionate move.)~
@1357 = ~Oh, Beshaba, such cheap theatrics! (She straightens and rolls her eyes. But for a brief moment before that she'd been passionately responding to your kiss.)~
@1358 = ~(Saccharine) Coward...~
@1359 = ~(She licks her red, red lips, and to your eyes they become even redder.)~
@1360 = ~(She blows you a kiss from a distance.)~
@1361 = ~(She slides her palm over your hand in a rare display of tenderness.)~
@1362 = ~(Salomeya uses very little dyes and powders; she doesn't need to. Those salves would only blur and vulgarize her vibrant beauty.)~
@1363 = ~(Her cheek is as soft as cream, and slightly cool.)~
@1364 = ~(Salomeya's eyes open wide, but she does not protest or withdraw.)~
@1365 = ~I understand that in your narrow little paladin-reared mind it means complimenting and rewarding my accomplishments as a woman... so, I appreciate the sentiment - truly, I do! - but no, thank you.~
@1366 = ~Marry you, carry your children... are you out of your mind or simply took a hit to the head?!~
@1367 = ~Eww, no. Marriage is so completely unnatural! If the gods wanted us to cleave to just one man, they wouldn't have created so many.~
@1368 = ~Ah, no. I already have six of these husband things, and at least two of them weren't dead last time I've heard.~
@1369 = ~Do issue forth a growl, darling. There's something leonine about you.~
@1370 = ~You're a feisty one - I like that in a man.~
@1371 = ~I gave up on trying to help you overcome your stupidity. It has now reached crippling proportions.~
@1372 = ~I profit by you, darling. What's not to like? Of course, if the stream of treasure dries up... but you won't let that happen, right?~
@1373 = ~I won't.~
@1374 = ~So, raking in money is all you like about me?~
@1375 = ~I neither know, nor care about gold. And I don't think that gold is what attracts you to me.~
@1376 = ~How tedious.~
@1377 = ~Your eyes aren't half bad either.~
@1378 = ~Then I shall continue to like you.~
@1379 = ~When we hit the bloodied mud,
and gasp for breath one last time
we'll call to our comrades-in-arms
In hopes that they have enough cash.~
@1380 = ~So let's drink for resurrection,
For the knowing priests everywhere
So let's drink for resurrection
And for gold that can bring us back.~
@1381 = ~You have the luck of a hero, darling, seeing how a little goblin hunting quest turned into a war on a regional scale.~
@1382 = ~As well ask me if I can breathe.~
@1383 = ~You're asking the wrong question, darling. What you need to be asking is if you're notorious enough for me to love *you*.~
@1384 = ~You doubt that? I was born into a race of lovers.~
@1385 = ~Hmm... you have the weirdest ideas sometimes, darling. Next time one of those should hit you, do us all a favor, and keep your mouth shut.~
@1386 = ~All my energy is directed at staying the same, for once one has achieved perfection, it's the only thing to do.~
@1387 = ~In my case any change is degrading. So no, of course not.~
@1388 = ~Change? Whatever for?~
@1389 = ~I put my pretty head on the pillow, close my pretty eyes... and then it's finally the new day and real things can start happening.~
@1390 = ~Definitely not about finding the true love of my life who'd turn me into a better woman, meaning a good-hearted hen with seven kids and three chins, gossiping with the neighboring hen about the evils of theatre and the bright future that awaits her kiddies in the beekeeping.~
@1391 = ~I don't waste my time dreaming; I get what I want.~
@1392 = ~Glory.~
@1393 = ~Very well, then the future should remain veiled.~
@1394 = ~A brave soul, but then, if you weren't you would not be standing here today, victorious.~
@1395 = ~It is fitting that each of them would tell you his or her fate.~
@1396 = ~For a time I remained in the North, living in the shadow of the Severed Hand's ruin, mourning the dead on the Fields of Slaughter and their grandeur.  As the legend traveled, a group of associates gathered to my abode. I taught and preached, and inspired many.

Our network of explorers and diplomats established preliminary contacts between Eldreth Veluuthra and the drow of a city that is not entirely unfamiliar to you. Presently, I am biding my time, gathering forces for the imminent War of Retribution and Liberation in the name of our son.~
@1400 = ~It does be a great change for me to look in the mirror and smile at my reflection. But I do be doing it every morn. I do be carrying a mirror you gave me on our adventures. They were many in the past years. 

I did become a Knight of the Order last month. Your parents did host a ball for the occasion. Sir Nord did come from the Dales, drunk heavily, laughed like thunder and did act like the proudest father. Then he did clap me on my shoulder, and asked when will I be asking him to give me away in marriage to 'Roederic's pup'. That's when I did have to ask him if half-orcs blush crimson, like humans, or deep green. ~
@1401 = ~It does be strange to find myself in a non-orc's body every morn, but I do be welcoming the change. People do not be judging me evil any longer on my appearances alone, though they do be expecting from me to be something that I'm not at times.

After a few more years as Sir Nord's squire I did be knighted to the Order, but I did not leave his side. We be cemented together now by comradely that did grow beyond my first crush on my benefactor and I do doubt that anything but death will part us. I do be happy now, warring for good, but I cannot help thinking that I did cheat and took an easy way out when I asked for reincarnation.~
@1402 = ~It does be strange to find myself in a human body every morn, but I do be welcoming the change. People do not be judging me any longer on my appearances alone, but on my deeds.

After a few more years as Sir Nord's squire I did be initiated into the Order as a knight, but I did not leave his side. Sir Nord was absolved of his vow, and we did get wed afterwards. 

I do be happy now, warring for good, with the love of my life to lead me, but I cannot help thinking that I did cheat and took an easy way out when I asked for reincarnation. I suppose that the world be too complex for the honorable and right choices to always lead to happy endings, and evil ones - to damnation. Sir Nord does agree.~

Besides that, someone made it all the way to Cormyr  -and that's with me expressly forbidding it! - to send me word that no heirs of mine would ever compete with their six cousins, seeing as my brother's family is ruling the lands fairly, loved by all and Lord Filip is nothing but a bad memory and a splotch on my family's honor. 

Well, I'm used to worrying about Nord Wind's reputation and happiness instead. ~

@1410 = ~I wandered for a while, but in time my interest in uncovering the truth hidden by the past and by memories turned into obsession and I settled in Silverymoon. I dove into the research of divination and necromancy to find my own roots. Locked alone with my scrolls and spells, I wasted over what could have been, trying to find my mother and father somewhere in Mulhorand or their shadows beyond the grave. My solitude was interrupted if rarely by the visits of a famous Waterdevian songstress, but in the end even her vivacity, taunts and greed could not call me back from the mists. ~
@1411 = ~I know that you'd understand, the way you always understood me. But let me tell you once more that any amount of pain and suffering was a small price to pay for what time we had, for the words of the ritual that Iselore said when he was consecrating our wedding.

I went back to Mulhorand with you, devoting my life to guiding the slaves to freedom and trying to bring about the downfall of the slavemasters.  You and I... we were both wanted, and both legendary. Once, the government's forces pursued us to the very portal, and to give you time to escape, I turned around, I cast every spell... and I let myself be captured. You came back for me, but it was too late. The soldiers hated me too much to let me live to face a trial. I was beaten to death, but you saved me from dishonor by attacking the escorts that were arranged to carry my body dissected into four parts to the four corners of Mulhorand.

In the end, the slavemasters achieved the opposite of what they wanted - I was not disgraced, not martyred, but became a symbol of hope, a eunuch slave who found freedom and love. Your name came to mean 'freedom' in the secret slaves' language of Mulhorand.

I lived thinking of you, and I died the same.~
@1412 = ~I know that you'd understand, the way you always understood me. But let me tell you once more that any amount of pain and suffering was a small price to pay for what time we had together, and the only thing that I regret is that you never decided if you wanted to marry me.

I went back to Mulhorand without you - and for that I wish I had a chance to beg your forgiveness. I didn't get that chance. I was helping a party of runaway slaves, when the government's forces pursued us to the very portal. To give them time to escape I turned around, I cast every spell... and I let myself be captured.

I didn't live to face my trial or to write you a letter. I was beaten to death that very night by the hateful soldiers, and my body, dissected into four parts, went to the four corners of Mulhorand.

In the end, the slavemasters achieved the opposite of what they wanted - I was not disgraced, but martyred.

Whatever the circumstances of my death, I want you to know that I lived thinking of you, and I died the same.~
@1415 = ~Our entry to Chessenta was nothin' short of triumphant. The Milord High Poofy Trousers himself rode out to meet us at the edge of the Adder Swamp, and the whole Barony was drinkin' and feastin' for a fortnight... at our expense I must say, but well, that's another story. Phlensos Ursuma even very kindly set a play and a jugglin' competition in our honor, and a better play at that than the one we saw in the Dragon's Eye, not that I want to come across as overly critical, seein' I slept through most of it anyways.

To cut a long story short, I found a lovely villa among the olive groves at the seaside to set you up properly, but when I wanted to resume my trade and decorate the place in grand taste that befitted you, my precious jewel, I found out that we ran out of money. 

Uhm, takin' that into account and also the fact that some poisonous bug must have bit me in the North infectin' me with wanderlust, I... er... we decided that the best way to rise capital was to adventure again. 'Tis proved to be the most profitable occupation I've ever engaged in. Well, maybe we ain't as respectable as is our wont, but our little villa has the most exquisite collection of antiquities in the whole of Chessenta and that's somethin' not to be trifled with!~

@1417 = ~Wee! We landed Oswald's ship right in front of my folk's house!

I have no idea just how many countries we went through and how many quests for glory we have undertaken, but I'm now absolutely and indisputably one of the most famous mages in the Realms, and my name is often mentioned right next to the Harpells.

@1428 = ~Predictably, your father hated me on sight, both for my race and my demeanor. He didn't sneer at me for long though, having met with an untimely, yet deserved, end. After his death, you won a small fortune in inheritance. The only sibling of yours who got a cut was a smart little brother who took our side. The rest of your family had to leave Luskan led by your widowed mother. I thought that you ought to have eliminated them as well, but you had a rebound of that surfacer's disease - mercy. Still, between your father's money and the spoils from the North we had an opportunity to settle in Neverwinter - the city I wanted to bring to its knees for personal reasons.

We entered the high society of Neverwinter outwardly, but dealt mainly in its underworld. So far our works have increased our fortunes hundredfold, and it seems that an open war between Neverwinter and Luskan is finally imminent. The war that Luskan should win thanks to our connections, of course. Then we shall rule Neverwinter in Luskan's name and Luskan itself shall become our province in time. The Legion Chimera had the right idea: the North is ripe for a Kingdom, they just started in the wrong place.~
@1429 = ~Predictably, your parents hated me on sight, both for my race and my demeanor. They dared not oppose me directly. After all I was a hero of the North, and they wanted to act just so badly.

Gradually, that surfacer's folly - love - weakened, and you were glad to see my back when I felt that I outstayed my welcome.

I returned to Neverwinter, exculpated by our doings in the North, and served in the Militia for a while. But exculpated and heroic didn't mean accepted. In a few years I realized that I was being a fool, trying to prove something to the surfacers. 

I went back North and settled in a place that did not reject me... or rejected me no more than anyone else. I served Malavon Despana and died in an honest battle... well, if you can call fighting mindflayers an honest battle.~

@1434 = ~Why, I returned to Waterdeep of course, covered with glory, which I quickly turned into capital and opened my own playhouse, the 'Beakon'. I run only the most talented, most glamorous shows in Waterdeep and I finally received at least one tenth of the acclaim that I deserve, with my playhouse being the most fashionable place in Waterdeep, and hordes of admirers and connoisseurs under my windows day and night. 

Political satire brings us to the point of closure from time to time, but thanks to my charm and skills it also pays for the luxuries I'm enjoying. However, the very first play I wrote and directed is still immensely popular and I always fall back on it if the current masterpiece is being temporarily prohibited. After all, it is quickly becoming a living classic. The 'Greenhorns in the North' is a lively play that tells the story of an inept party that manages to save the world only due to the wit of an incomparably beautiful bard, that I always play myself.

And, yes, yes, I announce every time that it's a work of fiction. As such, names, characters, places, and incidents either are a product of the author's imagination or are used fictitiously. Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, events, or locales is entirely coincidental. Ta-ta!~

I run only the most talented, most glamorous shows in Waterdeep and I finally received at least one tenth of the acclaim that I deserve, with my playhouse being the most fashionable place in Waterdeep, and hordes of admirers and connoisseurs under my windows day and night. 

Political satire brings us to the point of closure from time to time, but thanks to my charm and skills it also pays for the luxuries I'm enjoying. However, the very first play I wrote and directed is still immensely popular and I always fall back on it if the current masterpiece is being temporarily prohibited. After all, it is quickly becoming a living classic. The 'Greenhorns in the North' is a lively play that tells the story of an inept party that manages to save the world only due to the wit of an incomparably beautiful bard, that I always play myself.

And, yes, yes, I announce every time that it's a work of fiction. As such, names, characters, places, and incidents either are a product of the author's imagination or are used fictitiously. Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, events, or locales is entirely coincidental. Ta-ta!~
@1436 = ~Unfortunately, the information that the doppelganger gave me was true - my apprentice betrayed me. Blain met me outside the city walls, breaking a contract for the first time in his life, and together we fled like a pair of thieves. It rankled to be chased away from my native land, but as they say: better a life in exile than stoning at home.

Though the Neverwinter fiasco damaged Blain's reputation, he was able to find a steady supply of work in the East, in countries that care little for honor and where trust doesn't count for anything. I struggled to raise our three children in Lathander's light, but alas, we've lost our second son to the seductive lure of Thayvian politics and the power of the Red Wizards. My faith was almost shattered after that.

Yet I persevered and stayed true to the morning light. In the end the man who framed me was finally exposed as a pretender, a priest that paid Lathander only a lip service, but in truth served Shar. I was pardoned and we traveled to Neverwinter to renew our vows in the Temple of Lathander that someone else completed after Blain's departure. It is still breathtakingly beautiful, though not as beautiful as it might have been, had his magical hands finished their good works.~
@1437 = ~I returned to Neverwinter a celebrated hero of Icewind Dale and quickly submitted my resignation to the garrison. In a tenday, I was wed to Blain in the still unfinished Temple of Lathander. To my eyes it was more magnificent that day than when it was finally done. After the Temple was consecrated, we traveled from city to city, living at various courts and monasteries, wherever Blain's commissions or wanderlust took us. Over the years our family doubled in size, then the children left to seek fortunes of their own, and the two of us returned to Neverwinter to stay.~

@1451 = ~We can resume the experiment.~
@1452 = ~I neither understand, nor approve. Come and speak to me once you are over this folly.~
@1453 = ~You will come to understand your error in time. Drow as they are currently are not elves. Much was undone in the five thousand years of their Exile, and it cannnot be restored in one generation. You will require more than Rizdaer can give.~
@1454 = ~Certainly.~
@1455 = ~With me, you reject your heritage.  Regrettably, the human city and your blasphemous parents had corrupted you.~
@1456 = ~It is always a great pleasure to communicate with you.~
@1457 = ~How's your crusade against the humans going?~
@1458 = ~Do you have a favorite animal, Diriel?~

@1472 = ~Our relationship... Diriel, I don't want to hurt you, but I'd like us to remain friends, and nothing more.~
@1473 = ~You're a mad fanatic, and I hate everything you stand for. Don't you ever dare to presume I like you.~
@1474 = ~Diriel, I'm not trying to push you away, but I'd like a bit less attention. Perhaps, if we stop flirting, it would be better.~
@1475 = ~(His palm is narrow, his fingers elegant and flawlessly trimmed. A few faint alchemical stains are visible on the even, warmly-colored skin, a testimony to years of grinding herbs and mixing draughts.)~
@1476 = ~Do not move away immediately. Studying your touch is of great interest to me.~
@1477 = ~I believe that I am capable of recognizing your hand's touch without error by its ability to cause my skin to... to burn for the lack of a better term.~

@1483 = ~(Take a strand in your palm to thaw it out.) ~
@1484 = ~You have snow and ice in your hair.~

@1487 = ~(Diriel touches his hair where your hand just was and smiles inwardly. Then his brows shoot up and he looks at his hand in wonder.)~
@1488 = ~(Diriel cups your face in his hands and catches the eyelashes on your right eye between his lips.)~
@1489 = ~I believe to have resolved your problem. At least partially. (He catches the eyelashes on your left eye between his lips. Then he dries your eyes off with a pristine satin handkerchief that smells of herbs and summer.)~
@1490 = ~It is resolved now. I will start tracking the state of the ice accumulation on your eyelids in order to provide the solution in the timely manner.~
@1491 = ~You... you have uncommonly long eyelashes.~
@1492 = ~I did until you removed it. ~

@1497 = ~(He kisses your cheek, trying to make it look casual, but a blue spark dances in his eyes for a while afterwards.)~
@1498 = ~Only... only natural, I suppose. (He catches his breath.)~
@1499 = ~(He dabs a drop off the corner of your mouth after you finish drinking with a tip of his finger.)~
@1500 = ~I hope that your thirst is satisfied. (His tone is measured and cool, but there is a slight hint of courtship.)~
@1501 = ~(He doesn't give you his water skin, but pours some in his palm and offers it.)~
@1502 = ~Thank you. I am... I am not thirsty any longer.~
@1503 = ~(Lean over his hand and drink from it.) ~
@1504 = ~(Slap his hand away, flinging the water into his face.)~

@1508 = ~(He looks very surprised when you lift your head up. Surprised and maybe moved.)~

@1510 = ~Under other circumstances water would be considered a gift of life, <CHARNAME>.  Here we do not lack it due to snow coverage. However, learning to preserve your water store and finding water sources is important.~

@1527 = ~There is a high probability that we shall witness their mating dances. It is the right season for it.~

@1534 = ~Oh, I hoped it would lose. ~
@1535 = ~Surely you can read it yourself? It is a very distinctive pattern. Here is the wing brushing the snow, the feather prints, the beak print as it dipped its neck... the footprints... step... step...~
@1536 = ~Did... did he succeed?~
@1537 = ~(Smile.) I can nigh see it. ~
@1538 = ~All right, I am convinced - you can do it.~

@1542 = ~I perceive that you are glad to have me traveling with you. The feeling is mutual.~
@1543 = ~You have an enigmatic smile, <CHARNAME>. It brings to mind a number of appropriately romantic recitations that prove the everlasting lure of that which is yet unknown.~
@1544 = ~(He smiles back politely, showing even, very white teeth.)~
@1545 = ~I am overjoyed that you are in a cheerful mood, <CHARNAME>.~

@1547 = ~No. Actually I am quite happy.~
@1548 = ~Can't I do anything without you commenting on it?~
@1549 = ~I am.~
@1550 = ~I don't know. It's a strange, elusive thing. I am not exactly happy, but neither I am unhappy. I think I may even like it. ~

@1552 = ~(Diriel looks at you without a shade of understanding in his eyes. After a moments hesitation he nods curtly and... sighs.)~
@1553 = ~A cup of chamomile tea will help restore and balance your spirit. I shall brew it for you once we stop to break our fast.~
@1554 = ~If I could come up with a sufficiently comic topic, I would have done so. Alas, I do not make light of my cause, and I have no interest in speaking of banalities in the face of the elvendom's crisis.~
@1555 = ~While I do not condone perpetual cheerfulness, somber moods can lead to dangerous consequences in our kin of late, such as Retreat. You must attempt to... ahem... cheer up.~
@1556 = ~Then I erred in thinking that it was done on my behalf. I apologize.~
@1557 = ~Reading emotions is not my strong suit. However, if you need me to tell you of the landscape or animal tracks, I am at your disposal.~
@1558 = ~I deduce that you take pleasure in puzzling me.~
@1559 = ~Sighs are deceptive.~
@1560 = ~(By a coincidence, Diriel is glancing at you.)~
@1561 = ~(Share a knowing look.)~
@1562 = ~(You press your palms against your blushing cheeks.)~
@1563 = ~(Lower your eyes.)~
@1564 = ~(You see the tips of Diriel's boots as he noiselessly comes close to you... then they retreat.)~
@1565 = ~(When you look up, Diriel is attending to his duties.)~
@1566 = ~(And so you do not see him crossing the distance between you before he firmly touches your hand.)~
@1567 = ~I do not think that anything is wrong, however if there is... you can tell me.~
@1568 = ~I would have asked you to discontinue this, however blushing is involuntary. I wish it were less unnerving.~
@1569 = ~You are blushing. My appearance is not hideous or improper. I do not understa- (Diriel never finishes the sentence, suddenly blushing himself.)~
@1570 = ~If you are feverish, I can prepare some willow bark tea.~
@1571 = ~(Your silent exchange visibly pleases Diriel.)~
@1572 = ~I am glad to have encountered someone as perceptive as you are. (A co-conspirator's smile curves his lips.)~
@1573 = ~(Diriel nods sagely.) Precisely.~
@1574 = ~<CHARNAME>, I assure you I am quite proficient in this exercise, having observed the Great Mother's many creatures. (He gives you a lecherous look that puts your efforts to shame.)~
@1575 = ~You are neither a human, nor are you at a slave market. This is unbecoming to you.~
@1576 = ~I have not noticed many elven men in Luskan, and certainly none that compare to me, however I did not suspect that it affected you so much. This goes to prove yet another time that no elf should be raised among humans.~
@1577 = ~(Diriel shrugs and ignores you.)~
@1578 = ~Not many would call me a man of passion, however, I am certainly skillful.~
@1579 = ~I am pleased that it is you who are our commander, not your father's despicable... associate.~
@1580 = ~You showed keen wisdom in recruiting me.~
@1581 = ~Indeed.~
@1582 = ~Thank you.~
@1583 = ~And you are a very attractive woman, <CHARNAME>.~
@1584 = ~It is something that has been noted on a several occasions previously.~
@1585 = ~None and each of them. ~
@1586 = ~I have a better knowledge of the animals whose form I can take. Hence I wish to learn as many forms as I can. The world's infinite variety fascinates me. ~
@1587 = ~I am a druid, not a babe who queries his parents for a pet. ~
@1588 = ~There could be no definitive answer to this question. ~
@1589 = ~I question your sincerity, because you surround yourself with the enemy.~
@1590 = ~The progress is slow, however I have had much time for planning and preparation. Once the war is unleashed, it must be swift, to exterminate the parasites before they adapt and multiply.~
@1591 = ~You shall be notified of my successes by the diminishing of the stench in the air.~
@1592 = ~In this region I am pitted by necessity against the least obnoxious kind of humans - the barbarians.~
@1593 = ~(Diriel gives you an injured look and doesn't deign to reply.)~
@1594 = ~Do you require anything, my love?~
@1595 = ~(You hug Diriel.)~
@1596 = ~(Throw a smoldering glance Diriel's way.)~
@1597 = ~(Slide your fingers into Diriel’s blond mane.)~
@1598 = ~(You slap Diriel’s bottom.)~
@1599 = ~This climate is conductive to sharing warmth with someone, don't you find?~
@1600 = ~My lips keep getting so dry here!~
@1601 = ~Diriel, I am curious about your writing. You always scribble notes in your diary. What they are about?~
@1602 = ~(Tickle Diriel.)~
@1603 = ~(Stick your tongue out at Diriel.)~
@1604 = ~(You found a dried daisy flower in Diriel's medicinal bag.) 'He loves me...' 'He loves me not...' ~
@1605 = ~(Nestle close to Diriel.)~
@1606 = ~(Kiss Diriel on the lips.)~
@1607 = ~(Kiss Diriel's eyes.)~
@1608 = ~(Lean on Diriel.)~
@1609 = ~(Bite Diriel.)~
@1610 = ~Diriel, I have done some thinking, and I believe that our engagement was a mistake. I do not want to marry you.~
@1611 = ~(Diriel arches his golden eyebrow questioningly.)  Are you going feral already?~
@1612 = ~If you are hungry, dear heart, whatever the nature of your hunger, I can satiate you if we break for a while. ~
@1613 = ~(Disregarding anything and anyone around, Diriel draws you closer to him and nibbles at your neck.) I miss you. ~
@1614 = ~(He lifts his hand slowly and touches the corner of your mouth with the tips of two fingers.) ~
@1615 = ~I have been bitten many times, and I appreciate it that I do not need to draw poison from the wound this time. Or that it is indeed not a wound at all for that matter. And that you passion for me takes requires such dramatic form to express itself.~
@1616 = ~(He inhales deeply of your smell and kisses your hair.) ~
@1617 = ~Stay here until I count out ten heartbeats. One... ~
@1618 = ~Two...~
@1619 = ~(The interval shortens.) Three...~
@1620 = ~Alas, they are not as precise a measurement of time's passing as they used to be. My heart beats considerably faster when you are this close.~
@1621 = ~(As soon as your back touches his chest, he wraps his arms around your waist putting a protective palm on your stomach.)~
@1622 = ~My beautiful fiancée, I am overjoyed by the symbolism of this gesture. You are as willing to accept my protection, as I am willing to provide it.~
@1623 = ~You are exceedingly creative in suggesting new ways in which the lovers can kiss.~
@1624 = ~(He kisses the corner of your eye.)~
@1625 = ~(He closes his eyes as he guesses your intentions and stands very still, infinitely attentive to the every little detail of the kiss.)~
@1626 = ~My beautiful fiancée, I am blinded by you as is. (An embarrassed smile curves his lips.)~
@1627 = ~I... attempted a joke. It was an unfortunate idea.~
@1628 = ~(Bright and sharp blue, Diriel's eyes sometimes seems to be an object of art, a heirloom... even more so when he looks at you, and his glance warms up.) ~
@1629 = ~Each kiss is a journey. (He nods to himself; it's likely that a detailed case study will appear in his journal later in the day.)~
@1630 = ~Counting this kiss, the grand total of our kisses is.... (he presses his lips back to yours.) ~
@1631 = ~(Sigh.) I believe that it can be expressed as 'n plus one' at any given time.~
@1632 = ~I was anticipating this, however I was taken by surprise. There is no end to the contradictions in love.~
@1633 = ~This experience could potentially break my composure, <CHARNAME>.~
@1634 = ~And then you'll ravage me?~
@1635 = ~We can't have that. A pity, really. I do like kissing you once in a while.~
@1636 = ~(Laugh and kiss him again.)~
@1637 = ~I... I am sorry.~
@1638 = ~(Diriel taps his chin thoughtfully.) Very probably.~
@1639 = ~(Diriel seals your lips with a kiss of his own.) If we observe certain interval... in between... we might successfully kiss without causing any explosions.~
@1640 = ~You appeal to my primeval instincts in an unerring fashion, therefore managing to control the incontrollable. I wish I could document this, however I am always prevented from doing it by the need to confirm one detail or another, and once the experiment is under way, it cannot be interrupted.~
@1641 = ~As am I, however, we are both working towards constructing the environment where our kissing and the consequences thereof can be conducted safely.~
@1642 = ~(Diriel presses his cheek against the side of your forehead.) Quite soon we shall conquer this world and then time will be ours to spend as we please.~
@1643 = ~(He wraps his arm around your waist and murmurs into your ear.) Do not overburden your mind with worry. I am standing guard for you.~
@1644 = ~(Diriel strokes your hair.) How very similar it is to all others', and how very different, how very superior.~
@1645 = ~(He throws his cloak around you, so you both are wrapped in it.)~
@1646 = ~He loves you, however he asks you to keep away from his herbs, for he knows not when the need may arise for a particular draught.~
@1647 = ~I would have used a live flower if there were any!~
@1648 = ~Ah, how very presumptuous of you to think that I meant you.~
@1649 = ~Please, don't get cross. I'll keep out of your satchel. ~
@1650 = ~Don't worry, you have plenty of daisies there. ~
@1651 = ~'He loves me...'~
@1652 = ~Then I will leave you to your thoughts. It appears that you have a lot of thinking to do.~
@1653 = ~(Diriel takes the dried flower away from you and returns it to the pouch.)~
@1654 = ~I will ask you to be honorable and break our engagement.~
@1655 = ~Then consider acting as befits my fiancée.~
@1656 = ~Their pungency is irrelevant; their efficiency is unquestionable.~
@1657 = ~I have conducted some research and this was suggested as a method of terminating these out of control discussions.~
@1658 = ~(Diriel kisses you.)~
@1659 = ~I suspect that it is due to the fact these flowers tend to have an odd number of petals, and you are of the opinion that most men fall for you the moment they lay their eyes on you. Please, return the flower into the pouch, and let us continue on.~
@1660 = ~(Diriel sighs and holds the bag to gather the falling petals. Needless to say that the very last petal left on the flower is the 'He loves me' one.)~
@1661 = ~Are you satisfied with the result?~
@1662 = ~Yes! (You try to pin what's left of the flower to your cloak.)~
@1663 = ~Yes! (You try to put what's left of the flower into his hair.) ~
@1664 = ~(Tease) No!~
@1665 = ~(Serious) No.~
@1666 = ~(Diriel cringes.) The quantity is irrelevant. Live flowers should not be harvested to be used in this highly inaccurate method of gathering data on others' feelings.~
@1667 = ~Inaccurate?! It never failed me before.~
@1668 = ~Ah, my love, you are so easy to tease!~
@1669 = ~Yes, yes. It's glorious destiny is to be turned into one of your pungent draughts.~
@1670 = ~Don't you scold me; I'm your wife to be, not a servant.~
@1671 = ~I shall be most grateful if you will. No flower should be harvested to be used in this highly inaccurate method of gathering data on others' feelings.~
@1672 = ~It is not a presumption, but a deduction based on the fact that we are engaged to be married. I will not suffer you destroying my herbal stock while day-dreaming about a perpetrator.~
@1673 = ~And what will you do if it was someone else? ~
@1674 = ~(Diriel cringes.) No, this was not what I tried to imprint on you. Live flowers should not be harvested to be used in this highly inaccurate method of gathering data on others' feelings.~
@1675 = ~I urge you not to make this decision lightly. Our son and our cause will benefit greatly from this union.~
@1676 = ~Yes, and that is why I do not want to marry you. It's all about the cause....~
@1677 = ~I do not want this child either, Diriel. You promised me the herbs. I want them before it is too late.~
@1678 = ~I did not arrive to this decision lightly. But I do not love you, and I do not want to marry you.~
@1679 = ~I suppose so. Ah, Diriel, you have truly trapped me. ~
@1680 = ~I told you the truth. I will not harm you.~
@1681 = ~I do not. I will not harm you.~
@1682 = ~I am glad that you have come to this conclusion.~
@1683 = ~I can neither force nor convince you to love me. It is resolved then, if not to my satisfaction.~
@1684 = ~It is too late.~
@1685 = ~You lie!~
@1686 = ~Well, there are ways to deal with our relationship without harming the child.~
@1687 = ~Oh, really? I promise you that you will not come within a league from him, even if he is born. ~
@1688 = ~I suppose so. Ah, Diriel, you truly trapped me. ~
@1689 = ~I love you. I do not know how I can prove it to you, but I love you.~
@1690 = ~I... I believe you. I should not have doubted you.~
@1691 = ~It is not enough. I am sorry, Diriel, but our engagement is over. ~
@1692 = ~And I am to believe that these words are not calculated? You have a stone in place of a heart, and I am not going to suffer it through my entire life. ~
@1693 = ~I don't care, because I do not love you. ~
@1694 = ~(He cocks his head to one shoulder surveying the view.) I do not think it makes you more attractive.~
@1695 = ~Place your tongue where it belongs before it starts freezing in this position.~
@1696 = ~I suggest that you repeat this action when our lips are pressed against each other's in a kiss.~
@1697 = ~I see no abnormalities in the appearance of your tongue, <CHARNAME>.~
@1698 = ~(He tickles your neck...~
@1699 = ~(...with his tongue.)~
@1700 = ~An improvement, yes.~
@1701 = ~If I were shapeshifted into a feline, and you tickled my ears or chin... would I purr?~
@1702 = ~Clothes and amour greatly reduce the effectiveness of the procedure. Therefore, you would be more successful when we are without.~
@1703 = ~(Diriel stoically allows you to tickle him to your heart's content without making a single move.)~
@1704 = ~The last thing I have recorded was a... a poem. I will not have you suffer through its recitation.~
@1705 = ~Instead, I am resolved to purchase a compilation of classic texts. At the very least they will serve to educate you in the ways of our culture, unlike modern diatribes.~
@1706 = ~They are comprised of the useful data I collect, though I have noticed that I have penned a few frivolous ideas as well. Perhaps, it is time for me to start keeping two journals.~
@1707 = ~Every fact worthy of recording, categorizing and preserving for future research.~
@1708 = ~As of lately, I have been making a lot of observations on one woman, love and passion.~
@1709 = ~Let me examine the damaged tissues... (Diriel cups your chin and moves your head from left to right to better survey your lips.)~
@1710 = ~My beautiful fiancée, your lips are as perfect as the rest of you. They are the thing of magic, so teasing and mesmerizing, a gateway to your thoughts, an embodiment of a kiss.~
@1711 = ~Do not bite them, my love, drink plenty and the damage should heal.~
@1712 = ~They are... still? You are not adapting well to the climate, and this is worrisome. We need to accelerate the process of acquiring our kingdom, so we can create proper conditions for your gentle skin.~
@1713 = ~Halt then. (Diriel produces an ointment from his pouch.)~
@1714 = ~Here is a substance that might help. (He applies a liberal portion of sticky substance to your chapped lips. You can taste something sweet... perhaps strawberries?)~
@1715 = ~I have a foolhardy theory that frequent administering of this... (kiss) ... will keep them moist.~
@1716 = ~Specify the type of warmth to be shared. Is it bodily warmth? The warmth created by combusting wood or coal?~
@1717 = ~The warmth of one's beloved's smile, however scientifically unproven this particular source of heat may be?~
@1718 = ~This hypothesis is asking to be tested. (Diriel embraces you, pressing his cheek against yours.)~
@1719 = ~Bodily warmth is indeed an engaging concept.~
@1720 = ~I trust that you did not mean 'anyone', but rather someone who shares a special relationship with you. Someone like me.~
@1721 = ~We are elves, <CHARNAME>, one of our supreme qualities is that we are at ease with the elements.~
@1722 = ~However, we can experience the feeling of comfort that close proximity to a desirable representative of the same species creates.~
@1723 = ~(You hear a satisfying clap as your palm connects with the druid's hind parts and an unexpected squeal.) ~
@1724 = ~I have read about a certain species in Chult that has a thick hide, almost akin to metal plating. At times I entertain the thought of studying them further and shapeshifting into one.~
@1725 = ~I would prefer you do this when we have more privacy. ~
@1726 = ~I absolutely must to conduct an experiment to determine the attraction this particular action holds for you.~
@1727 = ~(Diriel gives you a smack below the waste.) Oh. I am starting to understand... (He manages a decent squeeze.)~
@1728 = ~It does not need the compaction. (Indeed, it is quite tight, if not precisely bony.)~
@1729 = ~(There is a familiar smell to his hair, of freezing leaves and autumnal herbs, slightly bitter, slightly cool, but made sharper and brighter by the frost.)~
@1730 = ~(You find a thick lock glued together by dried blood. The skin of his scalp is broken underneath.)~
@1731 = ~(Diriel winces and mumbles, without looking at his feet.) ...when there is no more efficient use for my healing....~
@1732 = ~(The thick, heavy hair parts as you path your fingers through it only to watch it close immediately behind; almost like water in a stream, if water can be golden.)~
@1733 = ~(Diriel leans his head back, his eyes closed with pleasure.) Mmgh... I love your tender digits.~
@1734 = ~You are impeding our progress, <CHARNAME>. I require an interval of time to regain the ability to think clearly.~
@1735 = ~You are challenging me to unleash a glance that I designed to make you melt. However, I prefer to save it for now.~
@1736 = ~(He stretches in a lazy, content fashion.)~
@1737 = ~(Diriel covers his eyes with his palm as if shielding himself from a bright light, then smiles and moves his hand up a bit to see if you are still looking his way.)~
@1738 = ~(Diriel presses you against his chest with uncharacteristic impulsiveness. Then he swirls you around, laughing. When he finally stands you back on the ground, there is a small self-ironic smile on his face.)~
@1739 = ~Indeed....~
@1740 = ~(He strokes your back; he seems particular to its lower reaches.)~
@1741 = ~(He pushes hair out of your eyes and kisses you.) We must disengage this embrace now. ~
@1742 = ~(Smile widely and shake your head negatively.)~
@1743 = ~What if I don't want to? ~
@1744 = ~That was a nice kiss!~
@1745 = ~I return to thee thy freedom! ~
@1746 = ~All right. ~
@1747 = ~Yet, I am still enthralled. Such are the puzzling realities of love.~
@1748 = ~It complimented the embrace you have given me.~
@1749 = ~We shall repeat this at the first opportunity.~
@1750 = ~You are endangering us all. However, I find it difficult to care.~
@1751 = ~(Diriel slowly embraces you, his arms encircling your shoulders with astounding care.)~
@1752 = ~I am sorry that I wasn't a man enough to save you from the cage of hatred your 'true love' is locking you in.~
@1753 = ~I understand, Mistress. You don't want me for your consort.~
@1754 = ~Rizdaer, I decided that I am ready to have a lover. I want us to make love... or whatever you call it in drow.~
@1755 = ~Those are the sweetest words I've ever heard.~
@1756 = ~And yet again I'm dizzy, and I don't care if it is a surfacer's love or a drow's ssinssrigg. You know, I have not ever craved a female day after day, night after night before I met you. And I doubt that I will ever stop now.~
